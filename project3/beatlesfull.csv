They were new for popular music in the way the Beatles were doing them. But jazz had sort of music videos, usually featuring dancers, since the 1930s, and there were other types of video shorts.","The answer to this question depends on how you define ‘music video’. 

There were a whole heap of short films of people playing music or even lip syncing to music before the Beatles - the Scopitones that someone mentioned. A film like *The Girl Can’t Help
It* (which the Beatles absolutely watched) is basically a compilation of rock’n’roll music videos with a fairly perfunctory narrative connecting them (a bit like the Beatles movies…).

So we have all of that, and the Beatles are not the first. 

But when people say ‘music video’ - especially in the 1980s and 1990s - in a big way they mean ‘the stuff on MTV’. And that kind of music video is a specific kind of thing. Firstly, it’s a promotional item produced by the record company. Secondly, it’s typically not just a band performing, it will have other footage, perhaps a narrative. Thirdly, it’s designed to be seen on television. 

That third one was more important in the 1990s than it is now, in the age of lyric videos on YouTube  etc. For context, pop fans rarely see music videos on television anymore. It’s not like there’s a Netflix ‘cool new videos’ show - so you’re watching the latest Taylor Swift video on YouTube, right? But television was for a long time incredibly important as a distribution channel for pop music, and influenced a bunch of things about how music videos worked - MTV was, of course, a TV channel. That played music videos.

So when did they start playing music videos on TV? Well, for that, you need TV channels that are likely to feature music that is not simply live. In the 1960s you start to get shows like *Top Of The Pops* or *American Bandstand* that increasingly feature artists not performing live but instead lip syncing their hits (for various reasons).

In the mid-1960s the Beatles were of course
very popular, and every show like *Top Of The Pops* in the world wanted an appearance by the Beatles. However, with only 4 Beatles and tours to tour and albums to record, not every show can get a Beatles performance. And so the Beatles recorded music videos like ‘Paperback Writer’ to replace the live or lip syncing performances they may have otherwise had to do on those shows and then sent out the videos across the world to say ‘sorry we can’t be there, but here’s a video for your show’. 

In terms of music television, it’s hard to confirm that the Beatles are the first - and you could argue that the promotional video made for Martha and the Vandellas’ ‘Dancing In The Street’ (recorded at a car factory in Detroit) is earlier, but I’m less sure whether that promo video was designed to be shown on TV, whereas ‘Paperback Writer’ explicitly was. 

But it is the tradition of those promo videos for TV shows like *American Bandstand* that eventually meant there was a stockpile of those kind of videos that you could base a cable television channel around. And The Beatles were certainly early on that particular trend, the one that specifically led to MTV and eventually the music video parts of YouTube.",,"It may be the first time it was done for rock and roll.

A video also helps the production team: it gives three minutes to setup the studio for the next bend, it's cheap and adds variety.Basically kinda sorta. It was a unique thing to do at the time but I can't say definitively it was never done before they did the ones for Rain and Paperback Writer.I make music videos for a living and I think this is the first instance I can think of of an actual music video (and not just a filmed live performance): [https://youtu.be/gbzc77Tz6PA?si=XX5\_Y\_MHjCUAyjyo](https://youtu.be/gbzc77Tz6PA?si=XX5_Y_MHjCUAyjyo)  
Even if it's really simple, there's a concept, a setting and acting. This was about three decades before The Beatles came around.In a way. They were new for popular music in the way the Beatles were doing them. But jazz had sort of music videos, usually featuring dancers, since the 1930s, and there were other types of video shorts.The answer to this question depends on how you define ‘music video’. 

There were a whole heap of short films of people playing music or even lip syncing to music before the Beatles - the Scopitones that someone mentioned. A film like *The Girl Can’t Help
It* (which the Beatles absolutely watched) is basically a compilation of rock’n’roll music videos with a fairly perfunctory narrative connecting them (a bit like the Beatles movies…).

So we have all of that, and the Beatles are not the first. 

But when people say ‘music video’ - especially in the 1980s and 1990s - in a big way they mean ‘the stuff on MTV’. And that kind of music video is a specific kind of thing. Firstly, it’s a promotional item produced by the record company. Secondly, it’s typically not just a band performing, it will have other footage, perhaps a narrative. Thirdly, it’s designed to be seen on television. 

That third one was more important in the 1990s than it is now, in the age of lyric videos on YouTube  etc. For context, pop fans rarely see music videos on television anymore. It’s not like there’s a Netflix ‘cool new videos’ show - so you’re watching the latest Taylor Swift video on YouTube, right? But television was for a long time incredibly important as a distribution channel for pop music, and influenced a bunch of things about how music videos worked - MTV was, of course, a TV channel. That played music videos.

So when did they start playing music videos on TV? Well, for that, you need TV channels that are likely to feature music that is not simply live. In the 1960s you start to get shows like *Top Of The Pops* or *American Bandstand* that increasingly feature artists not performing live but instead lip syncing their hits (for various reasons).

In the mid-1960s the Beatles were of course
very popular, and every show like *Top Of The Pops* in the world wanted an appearance by the Beatles. However, with only 4 Beatles and tours to tour and albums to record, not every show can get a Beatles performance. And so the Beatles recorded music videos like ‘Paperback Writer’ to replace the live or lip syncing performances they may have otherwise had to do on those shows and then sent out the videos across the world to say ‘sorry we can’t be there, but here’s a video for your show’. 

In terms of music television, it’s hard to confirm that the Beatles are the first - and you could argue that the promotional video made for Martha and the Vandellas’ ‘Dancing In The Street’ (recorded at a car factory in Detroit) is earlier, but I’m less sure whether that promo video was designed to be shown on TV, whereas ‘Paperback Writer’ explicitly was. 

But it is the tradition of those promo videos for TV shows like *American Bandstand* that eventually meant there was a stockpile of those kind of videos that you could base a cable television channel around. And The Beatles were certainly early on that particular trend, the one that specifically led to MTV and eventually the music video parts of YouTube."

39,1713886029.0,Musical degrees of separation with a Beatle,"A few days ago someone had an interesting thread of handshake degrees of separation with one or more Beatles.  

The closest was someone who met Paul in a guitar shop.

Meeting Paul in a guitar shop counts, since music is involved. 

For each degree. 

A.  There must be people who met. Attending a concert doesn’t count unless you went backstage or something like that. 

B.  There must be music involved somehow.  If you jammed with someone who jammed with someone who jammed with a Beatle that would count.

They did sign James Taylor but only released one album with him and then he went to Warner Bros.

1. Cello is my main instrument (though I'm not looking for easy cello lines) and I will say things like Eleanor Rigby and Yesterday are easy, I Am The Walrus... yeah not so much, can't even find proper sheet music.

- Martha My Dear
- Sexy Sadie
- Let It Be

I will admit I have found Hey Jude to actually be somehow harder than the ones listed above although I think I just Let It Be drilled into my head so the piano lines get mixed.

- Get Back

When I do a listen through their discography I try not to skip but can’t help avoiding a few in Beatles For Sale. I don’t think, in general, that it’s a weak album in the grand scheme of music, but compared to the likes of Abbey Road or Sgt Pepper or Revolver, it’s like trying to compare to perfection so it naturally *appears* to be not as good. That said, I tried to properly listen to Beatles For Sale again today and I couldn’t help but notice such a dip in lyric quality.

I mean yea, the early years are very generic, “I love her, she loves me” post-50s rock and roll, but Please Please Me develops into some very skilled song writing in With The Beatles and AHDN. And I Love Her, This Boy, Devil In Her Heart, All My Loving, There’s A Place… I mean they all show really profound use of language and poetry, it’s great, there’s some really good stories and ideas in there…

But then you come to BFS and you’ve got John trying to rhyme “rocking band” with “hurricane” and rhyming piano with piano. Honey Don’t, Kansas City and What You’re Doing is basically just the same lyric on a loop for 2 and a half minutes - and don’t get me wrong they’re fun songs and they *sound* great, but the lyrics are dire!

This has been discussed at length, and it is one of the main critiques of BFS. You might as well delete this.Sometimes I forget Lennon/McCartney wrote every song in existence, thanks for the reminder!As others have mentioned, several songs you listed weren't written by The Beatles. And the ones written by Lennon/McCartney are transitioning from the gleeful, boy band anthems to serious themes of gloominess, failed romance, and disaffection. Even the most arguably upbeat L/M composition (""I'll Follow the Sun"") is pensive and melancholy.               

It's been reported that the group was tired and a bit ground down by life on the road and the demand for new product to be created and recorded when they got home.  The unimaginable fame was also starting to show it's darker side and the initial heady rush of becoming an unmatched phenomenon was wearing off. This album is a very good reflection of were they were, and they still brought the goods better than anyone else.The first 5 songs of Beatles for Sale is the best 5 song run of any of their albums imo. Love that album!FYI if you're on Spotify you can see the credits for who wrote each song, and the Beatles did covers up through Help! "

The cape caper
The story behind the cape that the Beatles wore when they came to Australia was that in Amsterdam, when they were on the canal trip, waving to all of the fans, John spots a young man wearing a cape.   He really likes it, as do the other Beatles and they say something about wanting one of those capes to Mal Evans.   Mal chases this young guy down and finds out what he can about the cape.   If I remember correctly, the guy gives him the cape and the boys have a set custom made for them.   But that part might not be totally correct. 

Anyhow....Neil Aspinall talks about this in the Anthology, that they must have been made out of poorly made materials because once they got wet in Sydney, the dye in the cloth ran and when they took them off in the hotel, the Beatles had blue-ish (not Blue Meanie) skin!  

However, they obviously really liked the capes because they continued to use that style in the movie and cover for Help!

From here http://www.meetthebeatlesforreal.com/2014/06/the-cape-caper.htmlThe real coats are actually black, as seen in the Ticket to Ride scene in the HELP! movie.

How does this relate to their fame? I think there are several explanations: 

1. It's rare for a celebrity to be shot by a crazed fan. Shortly before his death, Lennon even signed an autograph for his killer (and there's a photo of it). Can you find another similar case? This event adds a legendary color to his life. Even if you're not a Beatles fan, you'll be curious about what he did and then go learn about him. 

2. Murder is a crime, being killed is a tragedy. The murderer is evil, and the murdered Lennon naturally stands on the opposite side of evil. The reason ""Imagine"" is so popular is partly because the person who sang this song, calling for peace, was shot. Singing this song in memory of Lennon has become a call against violence. 

3. Lennon participated in some social movements. Although he quieted down after his green card was rejected in the US, his death tied the two together, and Lennon became a martyr in people's minds. Lennon was not a saint, but who cares? He's already dead. 

4. McCartney is alive today and has become the richest musician in the world. He's alive and well, which seems to take away some of the legendary color. And he's the richest musician? It's too commercial, too vulgar, and there's a strong smell of money about him. (Public opinion) 

**II. Lennon was more candid and sharp in public, while McCartney was relatively restrained and low-key.**

 1. Facing the press 

a) Before the Beatles disbanded: Anyone who knows a little about the Beatles knows that all four of them were funny in interviews, but compared to the others, McCartney was a bit like the team's diplomat, responsible for saying things that were said but not really said to dodge the media, while Lennon was responsible for making jokes. When faced with some absurd questions, he was good at sarcasm, especially humorous. After watching these interviews, it's hard not to like Lennon. (When McCartney gets angry, he also comes out with some great lines, but most of the time he appears exceptionally cold and indifferent, smiling at you and not saying much. His highlights are relatively few.) 

b) After the Beatles disbanded: Lennon often spoke ill of McCartney in front of the media, or directly expressed dissatisfaction with the Beatles. McCartney either didn't answer such questions, or answered them in a casual manner, rarely criticizing Lennon or other bandmates. From the perspective of news value, what Lennon said is indeed more likely to pique public interest, so his exposure is naturally greater. (After all, everyone knows you used to have a good relationship, so isn't it more interesting to hear something negative? And it's also considered more sincere) 

2. Lyrics 

According to many, Lennon seemed to unreservedly present himself to the audience. His lyrics were mostly written in the first person, expressing his feelings. McCartney, on the other hand, often wrote lyrics from a third-person perspective, telling other people's stories, using other people's stories to express his feelings. Lennon also said that McCartney's lyrics were very unspecific. This difference means that 1) the audience can't really get into McCartney's heart, but they feel very close to Lennon. 2) The public thinks Lennon is very thoughtful, while McCartney lacks depth. (In fact, not only in lyrics, but also in everyday speech, Lennon would say whatever came to mind, while McCartney didn't like to speak his mind. Denny, McCartney's ten-year teammate in Wings, once said that McCartney was the best at hiding his emotions he had ever seen.)",Sounds like ypu spend far to much time maturbating over the statistics of history and not enough time enjoying it all.,"**Final thoughts**

McCartney's position in the music industry is already very high, but he gives people an impression—that he is not as good as John Lennon. I think this is wrong. For the past 40 years, Paul McCartney has been asked about Lennon by everyone, and he has always expressed his love, respect, and admiration for Lennon in interviews, making people feel that he also feels that he is not as good as Lennon (in fact, he has always insisted that the two are equal, and has said so). But please don't forget, in the one-word game in the 1970s, Lennon gave McCartney the word ""extraordinary"", and in 1980, he said that in his life, apart from his wife Yoko, he only invited one person to collaborate with him, and that was Paul McCartney. The two of them are equal. If it was Paul McCartney who had passed away, and not John Lennon, I believe that the living John Lennon would also commemorate his old friend in the same way as Paul does.",Actually in the John vs. Paul race over the course of the Fabs outputI think Lennon's ahead by a few tunes.,"Because we didn't get to watch John grow old.

For the past 40 years, Paul McCartney has been asked about Lennon by everyone, and he has always expressed his love, respect, and admiration for Lennon in interviews, making people feel that he also feels that he is not as good as Lennon (in fact, he has always insisted that the two are equal, and has said so). But please don't forget, in the one-word game in the 1970s, Lennon gave McCartney the word ""extraordinary"", and in 1980, he said that in his life, apart from his wife Yoko, he only invited one person to collaborate with him, and that was Paul McCartney. The two of them are equal. If it was Paul McCartney who had passed away, and not John Lennon, I believe that the living John Lennon would also commemorate his old friend in the same way as Paul does.Actually in the John vs. Paul race over the course of the Fabs outputI think Lennon's ahead by a few tunes.","Why is the most famous member of The Beatles not Paul McCartney?Why do people associate The Beatles with John Lennon? After all, most of The Beatles' biggest songs were written by Paul. Because we didn't get to watch John grow old.  He's frozen in time.[deleted]OP has waaay too much time on their hands.I think you are underestimating how lennon’s assassination retroactively influenced how the band was perceived. It’s hard for Paul to compete with a band mate who died for our sins 🤷


That said I think it’s changed a bit. McCartney stopped putting out such lightweight music like he was doing a bit in the late 70s and 80s, and I also think people began to realize his Beatles work was also very pioneering and experimental in its own way (Eleanore rigby, yesterday)

But yeah, being a sometimes mysterious asshole as Lennon could be, makes you the cool one to a certain extent as opposed to being an always upbeat nice dude who just happens to be a songwriting genius.

Did I mention that John is sort of my “favorite” Beatle although I am a staunch Paul defender? I cannot imagine the Beatles having anywhere near their impact without Paul. His songs are the most timeless, whereas John’s are very much a timestamp of 60s experimentalismThe whole ""getting murdered in the street by a psycho with a handgun"" thing really draws focus.So my dad and I are huge Beatles fans, one of the things we really bonded on when I was growing up. He’s 73 and I’m 26, we had almost 50 years dividing us. Music to me is something bridges people together, and his love for the Beatles was something that responded with me.
I say all that because my dad and people around that time all seem to love and respect Pauls talent and overall standing in the band. He was the driving force from Pepper onward. The Beatles are something I bring up in conversations with people of that age all the time especially back when I bartended. Everyone I spoke to always loved Paul, especially women.
While growing up and learning the Beatles catalog at my age and in that time period, John was who I gravitated towards. I think a lot of people my age or younger tend too. John was a poet and a fashion influencer, he was extremely tortured and full of self doubt. His murder will always be remembered because he preached unified peace.
My dad and I had this conversation while we watched the Get Back Sessions. He has a fondness for John but Paul is the guy he thinks of when talking about the Beatles. While I wear round glasses and an olive green jacket because I think John Lennon is still one of the coolest guys to ever live.
Little side note my step mom who grew up with the Beatles like my dad told us during our conversation that George Harrison is the Beatle who should be most famous. Everyone has an opinion.**I. Lennon is dead, and he was shot. McCartney is still alive and well.** 

How does this relate to their fame? I think there are several explanations: 

1. It's rare for a celebrity to be shot by a crazed fan. Shortly before his death, Lennon even signed an autograph for his killer (and there's a photo of it). Can you find another similar case? This event adds a legendary color to his life. Even if you're not a Beatles fan, you'll be curious about what he did and then go learn about him. 

2. Murder is a crime, being killed is a tragedy. The murderer is evil, and the murdered Lennon naturally stands on the opposite side of evil. The reason ""Imagine"" is so popular is partly because the person who sang this song, calling for peace, was shot. Singing this song in memory of Lennon has become a call against violence. 

3. Lennon participated in some social movements. Although he quieted down after his green card was rejected in the US, his death tied the two together, and Lennon became a martyr in people's minds. Lennon was not a saint, but who cares? He's already dead. 

4. McCartney is alive today and has become the richest musician in the world. He's alive and well, which seems to take away some of the legendary color. And he's the richest musician? It's too commercial, too vulgar, and there's a strong smell of money about him. (Public opinion) 

**II. Lennon was more candid and sharp in public, while McCartney was relatively restrained and low-key.**

 1. Facing the press 

a) Before the Beatles disbanded: Anyone who knows a little about the Beatles knows that all four of them were funny in interviews, but compared to the others, McCartney was a bit like the team's diplomat, responsible for saying things that were said but not really said to dodge the media, while Lennon was responsible for making jokes. When faced with some absurd questions, he was good at sarcasm, especially humorous. After watching these interviews, it's hard not to like Lennon. (When McCartney gets angry, he also comes out with some great lines, but most of the time he appears exceptionally cold and indifferent, smiling at you and not saying much. His highlights are relatively few.) 

b) After the Beatles disbanded: Lennon often spoke ill of McCartney in front of the media, or directly expressed dissatisfaction with the Beatles. McCartney either didn't answer such questions, or answered them in a casual manner, rarely criticizing Lennon or other bandmates. From the perspective of news value, what Lennon said is indeed more likely to pique public interest, so his exposure is naturally greater. (After all, everyone knows you used to have a good relationship, so isn't it more interesting to hear something negative? And it's also considered more sincere) 

2. Lyrics 

According to many, Lennon seemed to unreservedly present himself to the audience. His lyrics were mostly written in the first person, expressing his feelings. McCartney, on the other hand, often wrote lyrics from a third-person perspective, telling other people's stories, using other people's stories to express his feelings. Lennon also said that McCartney's lyrics were very unspecific. This difference means that 1) the audience can't really get into McCartney's heart, but they feel very close to Lennon. 2) The public thinks Lennon is very thoughtful, while McCartney lacks depth. (In fact, not only in lyrics, but also in everyday speech, Lennon would say whatever came to mind, while McCartney didn't like to speak his mind. Denny, McCartney's ten-year teammate in Wings, once said that McCartney was the best at hiding his emotions he had ever seen.)Sounds like ypu spend far to much time maturbating over the statistics of history and not enough time enjoying it all.**Final thoughts**

hair down to his knee- first beatle to grow his hair out which was pretty uncommon at the time (also objectively had the best hair)

got to be a joker- he did [this appearance](https://youtu.be/_462zXVSDWo?si=6D4gL-jHaFXVxuZT) not too long before

he just do what he please- he got fairly argumentative during late beatle sessions and argued for his own vision

second verse is ringo by process of elimination sorry ringo i can’t think of anything

[edit: actually, “he wear no shoeshine” could be a metaphor for ringo’s drumming style, he doesn’t like to be flashy and would rather play as a strong reliable beat, like an beat up old work boot over a shiny new one. tho unclear]

third verse; john 

he bag production- spotify says “bad production” which i thought was a reference to his insecurity in music skills, but other sites say “bag” which could be a reference to his and yoko’s bagism, either way works lol

walrus gumboot- self explanatory

ono sideboard- living with yoko = sharing furniture

hold you in his armchair / you can feel his disease- mental illness meant john had very tumultuous relationships with people close to him

last verse; paul

roller coaster- helter skelter reference⁉️ it’s a ride but not a roller coaster lol unsure

got to be good looking- the cute beatle :~]

he’s so hard to see- there was a fracture in his and john’s relationship by this point, likely referring to their communication issues

90,1713656598.0,Paul McCartney contributions to George Harrison songs?,"Please could you share any knowledge of contributions Paul made to George's songs, ideally with some references (e.g. an article or interview)?

I'm quite interested in how involved Paul was in George's songs, particularly as there has been a longstanding view of Paul dismissing George.

Notable examples I'm aware of:

1. Something - Paul wrote and performed a beautifully melodic baseline, which stands amongst the very best in the Beatles catalogue. I believe Paul originally wrote a more elaborate baseline, which George vetoed.

2. Taxman - Paul wrote and performed the iconic guitar solo. I understand George was pleased Paul took such a vested interest in his song.

3. While My Guitar Gently Weeps - I believe Paul wrote the piano introduction, which really kicks the song off, though I recognise the song stands out for other reasons e.g. Clapton's solo.

4. Long, Long, Long - I know that Paul played the organ, which gives the song uniqueness. But I don't know if Paul wrote the organ part.

Even some of the lyrically “John” songs had help from Paul musically to make the song that much better  (the ending of a Day In The Life, for example.) I can see how the other guys would think he was bossy, but they would have broken up years before if Paul hadn’t stepped up."

Eric Idle, of Monty Python and a good friend of George's, tells the story of complaining to George that it wasn't fair, he wasn't getting enough screen time in one of the Python movies. George responded by saying ""I was in a band with John Lennon and Paul McCartney.....""","Human relationships are complex.

Paul and George were childhood friends. Paul put George in the band, the famous Raunchy audition in the top of the bus. John was the one with hesitations about letting George join when he was so young, not Paul.

Over time, John and George seemed to sync on a lot musically and culturally. They got into LSD at the same time. They were also the big drivers of the transcendental meditation India Krishna stuff. People forget that because John got disillusioned with it, so they remember George as the Hindu Beatle, but it was originally George and John. She Said She Said, Paul walked out of those sessions and left George, John, and Ringo to work on it. Revolution 9 is mainly a product of John and George.

But, when George debuted I Me Mine for the rest of the band, John was the one who ignored it and danced around while Paul worked on it. The final recording on the album is solely a product of George, Paul, Ringo, and Phil Spector. George even references this in the dialogue before the Anthology recording of the unedited take. 

Obviously, George could like or dislike both of them, he doesn’t need to feel the opposite way towards one or the other, but a lot of speculation that they hate each other comes from the fact that George continued playing with John throughout the breakup, and didn’t play with Paul until after John’s death (solely for a memorial song and then the reunion songs). There’s this idea that George loved John and Ringo, but hated Paul. If you solely look at collaborations, it does seem to hold merit.

On the other hand, George, Paul, and Ringo attended Eric Clapton’s wedding and were willing to go on stage and play together. There had been speculation of animosity over Paul not attending the Concert For Bangladesh, but the stated reason Paul and John never attended was because they didn’t want press speculation of a Beatles reunion to overshadow the cause he was trying to bring attention to. If George did feel snubbed, he never mentioned it later.

George invited Paul to appear in the When We Was Fab video, but Paul had prior engagements and couldn’t. Supposedly it was Paul’s idea to replace himself with a left-handed bassist in a walrus costume.

Now And Then is another point of contention. There’s kind of an idea for a while that George just got sick of working with Paul. But now that Now And Then has been released, let’s be honest, George was right to abandon work on it. The technology required to finish it didn’t exist five years ago, let alone in the 90s. A lot of the history of recording technology would need to be changed to include Now And Then on Anthology 3. And George wasn’t hurting for money back then, he just had a big hit with Cloud Nine and Got My Mind Set On You, he had just had a successful tour in Japan, if he really HATED Paul, he could have turned down Free As A Bird and Real Love as well.

George’s house was originally owned by Sir Frankie Crisp, who had carved proverbs onto the walls. One went “scan not a friend with a microscope glass. You know his faults, now let his foibles pass.” George loved that one, he quoted it in his song The Answer’s At The End. He would use it to describe his feelings toward Paul. In an online AMA near the end of his life, someone asked George if Paul pissed him off. He quoted the proverb, then said that enough time had passed for them to realize “we’re both quite cute.” 

When George was undergoing cancer treatments, he lived in a house owned by Paul, who let him stay there so he could go to his treatments in peace without attracting press attention. George died in that house.","theory, but from my point of view, Harrision resented McCartney, not only because he found him bossy and self important, but also because Lennon took McCartney more seriously..

I think Harrison looked up to Lennon, and admired him, and I think it hurt him deeply that it was Lennon-McCartney and not Lennon-Harrison.

A quote from Tom Petty, a close personal friend. And a write up from an article.

Petty explained that Harrison “really, really admired John”.

But it seems that as bandmates they eventually just couldn't really work together, while as friends they ultimately had a bit of a love-hate brotherly thing going on, with Paul being the condescending older brother-type who doesn't quite realise just how much the younger 'brother' resents it.","I think the dispute was purely over matters musical. At one point George said he wouldn't play in a band with Paul, but ""as mates, they were fine.""","Didn't George pass at one of Paul's properties?

It probably goes without saying that Paul returned those sentiments, he performed at the concert for George and I think any negative sentiments between them probably stemmed from George resenting Paul’s “big brother” role.

To clear up space they would often do what's called a reduction mix, which mean you would mix the song, and put that mix onto 1 track, meaning everything on that part was set in stone, but now you have more tracks to play with. There's also a lot of studio terms, like SI (superimposition) which is basically a fancy word for overdub but you play the tape back while doing it. Something like ""SI onto 4"" means that's an overdub on take 4 of the song.

Then they (well, George Martin and the recording engineers) could take all those 4 tracks and reduce (re-record) them to only one or two tracks (called bouncing down) to free up some tracks. Then The Beatles could add the vocals or extra instrumentation to those empty tracks. That's how recordings worked for years before digital recording came around. 


By the time of Sgt Pepper, which was still recorded on 4 track technology, The Beatles were reducing tracks multiple times to keep layering more complicated instruments and sound effects and multilayered vocals, and some sounds would get 'buried in the mix' (aka became virtually inaudible).

He’s a very very very poor man’s Ed Sheeran.I would save the nepotism criticism for people who actually _got anywhere_ thanks to it.This is drivel, Sean in particular has been making great music for almost three decades.The answer must be McCartney since Lennon here has been involved in numerous other successful and interesting projects.Why are they talking like they're some new act that is releasing music? They've been musicians for decades. 

Also not their fault their dads are mega famous!I’m not sure The Guardian opinion section is in much of a position to preach about nepotism, tv presenter Adrian Chiles’ column in The Guardian is a direct result of him being married to the editor. ‘I have a urinal in my flat and it has changed my life – so why are people appalled?’ and ‘If dishwasher-loading was a sport, my dad would be world champion’ have been two of the gems he’s blessed us with since getting the job.They’re not good because they didn’t have the incentive to work as hard. John and Paul busted their asses for years writing songs and playing gigs together before they really started to get good. The goal was to be famous and rich. It seems like Sean and James are just doing this for fun, which there isn’t anything wrong with doing, but the pressures that drove their parents to be the best songwriting team in history aren’t there.Since when does anyone have to do music that sounds better than the Beatles?"

Do you know any children's songs from that time that sound similar to the original outros of Strawberry Fields Forever?"

112,1713677304.0,Would you guys say that Hunter Davies only ever authorised biography of The Beatles is still relevant today?,,beatles,9,Competitive_Serve_69,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7b14b884df60>,Would you guys say that Hunter Davies only ever authorised biography of The Beatles is still relevant today?,3,"[Comment(id='l0k722v'), Comment(id='l0ooaia'), Comment(id='l0kpaf1')]",I would say it’s a reasonably good but PG13 account of what happened. It’s good because it gives you background on the fours parents etc and what Liverpool was like etc.,"What makes something relevant? Let’s say that relevance is based on understanding the Beatles. 

From a historical perspective, sources on the Beatles are either going to be primary - contemporaneous, from the times - or secondary - based on historical research and thinking about primary sources (in contrast, Wikipedia is tertiary). 

Hunter Davies’ book is a primary source, in that he was there at the time witnessing stuff, interviewing the band in the 1960s. Every biography since almost has to based partially on Davies’ book - it set the historical narrative in a lot of ways.

But - like every primary source - we know things now that Davies didn’t know then (e.g., Lewisohn found things out about why EMI signed the band only a decade ago). And an authorised biography inevitably is told from the artist’s perspective to some extent, in ways that colour how the reader interprets things - a married man might not want to mention affairs he’s had, but they still are consequential events in his life. Nobody really likes to talk about recording contracts and how much money they’re all making, but that’s consequential too. And something written at the time doesn’t have the benefit of perspective - maybe things that seemed important then are now a bit dumb in retrospect.

In contrast a secondary source - a more modern Beatles biography - has the benefit of time and research. Unlike Davies, a modern biographer can also read what the wife thought about the affair, what the half-sister thought about the childhood, what the PR man thought about what he saw during the Apple years, etc (they all inevitably wrote books about their experiences with the Beatles). These points of view can be illuminating or banal or frustratingly too-careful. Additionally the modern Beatles biographer inevitably has more ability to contextualise the Beatles and what different things meant and how they affected things in ways that weren’t as clear at the time (and conversely it can be interesting reading Davies and seeing bits and pieces that differ from established wisdom). But of course, the biographer always has some agenda; Peter Brown and Albert Goldman are notorious in this regard, but someone like Mark Lewisohn isn’t a robot either, and has biases. We all do, and historians are part of we there.

So for some things Davies is a very interesting first draft of history, and sometimes you’re getting things straight from the horse’s mouth because of the nature of the authorised biography. Sometimes if you are getting to reading it after reading other biographies you realise, ‘oh they were all getting that from Davies’. Other times, it’s going to be a bit misleading. Such is the way with any biography though - the important thing is to read it with some critical thinking. But that’s the case for anything!",Glad you said Lewisohn has biases.,,,,,,,,"What makes something relevant? Let’s say that relevance is based on understanding the Beatles.

And the rest: wild and inventive, melodic—and then the whole back end is like the end of a jaw-dropping fireworks display, where they just throw everything they have left into the cannon and fire it off, like they knew this was the last time, which I guess they did. 

Followed by “Her Majesty,” because it was dumb and cheeky, and they were The Beatles.

I have conflicting feelings about its Beatley-ness.It’s been discussed as nauseam in this sub already - but like everything he’s done it’s just not good 

Not terrible…but absolutely forgettableYeah. It’s great. Well done. Cool collaboration. 
I hope they feel comfortable working together and can just shrug off unreasonable expectations or criticism from irrelevant people out there."

Apple employee Ross McLoughness was cleaning out boxes in the office basement and finds box of various items Mal Evens stowed away after the session. In this box were the very towels Ringo used on his drumkit, and this discovery makes waves in the drum community:

Vinnie Colaiuta reports, “I could have sworn it was terry towelling,” while adding, “I did a shootout years ago with Zappa where we spent a week trying terry, dobbie and plain linen tea towels on the toms, and we were both convinced that the terry nailed the sound. I never even thought of waffle.”

Session drummer Omar Hakim claims, “I knew it — Nothing else gives a tom the air and bounce of linen waffle.”

After analysis was performed on the towel, it was concluded the towel was, specifically, an English linen tea towel, 50.5cm X 34cm, combination plain and twill weave, confined to the period between 1959 and 1964, thread count was 150, with vegetable-based dye.
Further analysis concluded that the stain in the corner of the towel was likely from a Branston Pickle.

It was also a nice touching tribute to him I am sure he would have loved the finished version.,I'm in the minority but I didn't like the changes they made to Real Love at some point.  George's little guitar fills were a lot more musical and fitting on the original release than what later appeared on the DVD version.,"As someone who has been quite interested in the Beatles reunion sessions for decades, and finding out as much as I could, and hoping that one of these days we would eventually get to hear a completed ""Now and Then,"" I was more hopeful that there was a George guitar solo that had been recorded during the sessions.  His guitar work on ""Free as a Bird"" and ""Real Love"" was phenomenal, and among some of his best work from his entire career.  It's a shame that his contributions to the finished ""Now and Then"" was quite minimal, and his guitar playing in the mix should have been much more prominent.  It's too quiet.  I think if the quality of John's demos had been better, or the MAL technology had been available, or if George had still been alive today, we would have gotten another beautiful slide guitar solo from him.  That being said, and while there are a few things about ""Now and Then"" that I wished were there (more George, the dropped ""I don't want to lose you"" part of the song), I still love the final result, and am so glad that we as Beatles fans got another great song from the boys.","You can definitely feel George's absence on Now and Then.  I'm not a George fanboy or anything, but he completely elevated Free As A Bird and Real Love-- its pretty much George playing a guitar duet with John.  Every verse is something new and different.

I can understand McCartney's choice to keep the solo simple.  It's not that he couldn't have made it complex, it's that it would have been a fabrication.  The easiest fix to the other two songs is that they could have got Julian or Sean to fill in John's voice and they didn't, intentionally.

His guitar work on ""Free as a Bird"" and ""Real Love"" was phenomenal, and among some of his best work from his entire career.

I'm not a George fanboy or anything, but he completely elevated Free As A Bird and Real Love-- its pretty much George playing a guitar duet with John.  Every verse is something new and different.

It's incredible that they were completed and released.

""Free As A Bird"" and ""Real Love"" really showcase George Harrison's incredible guitar skills. His playing had such a unique style that really stands out. While Paul did his best to emulate that on ""Now & Then,"" it just wasn't the same. It's a shame George wasn't too fond of ""Now & Then"" making them give up on it; it would have been great to hear more of his work beyond the acoustic guitar parts.

Also, I'm hoping for a remix of the first two tracks to further refine John's vocals. The difference between Jeff Lynne's polished version and the AI-enhanced version is quite noticeable.

What are your guy’s thoughts?“Should have been” makes me laugh. I think The Beatles knew pretty well what “should have been.” But hey, I guess it’s all subjective at this point with being able to put together endless playlists. 

With that said, I’ll quote Paul - “it’s the bloody Beatles white album, shut up.”"

a","Came across this nice write up by Yoko shortly after Linda passed.

>The first time I met Linda was at one of the Beatles’ recording sessions. Paul introduced her to us. She was attractive, obviously—she had a sunshine smile—but I thought that there was a certain vulnerability about her. Later I came to understand that that impression was wrong, because when I think of Linda’s life, I think of a very strong woman.

>One day, around the time of that first meeting, Paul brought in to the studio some photographs of Linda in New York, in front of the building where she grew up. She was wearing a camel coat and a white scarf, just looking casual and glancing around. That is the Linda I remember from that time.

>During the Beatles’ sessions, Linda and I quickly learned that our husbands were not all buddy-buddy. John and Paul were both talented but very strong-willed people. There was some tension there. Linda and I left them alone. But we didn’t go chummy-chummy, wink-wink, “Aren’t they silly boys?” either. We both stood by our men. That was how we were.

>Then came the Beatles’ breakup. The world blamed it on Linda and me. The attack was like a storm. I think the fans needed a scapegoat, and they chose us! We both had the love and protection of our husbands. Linda had that very much from Paul. But still, it could not have been easy for her.

>The long years after the breakup were not easy, either. John and Paul were not talking. John and I would play Paul’s latest Wings record in our kitchen. John would say some nice things. He couldn’t say it to Paul, but when Paul was not around, John would say nice things about Paul. When Paul and Linda got a farm in Scotland, John said, “That’s Linda. She’s good for him.”

>Was the ice finally starting to melt? In the late Seventies, Paul and Linda came to visit us a few times in New York. In a fine old Liverpool tradition, the two guys did most of the talking, and we sat beside them as Paul held Linda’s hand and John held mine. It was nice to see the guys talk after all those years, even if a little stiffness existed between them.

>After John’s passing, Sean and I started to receive Linda’s beautiful calendar every year. We felt her warmth; and as a photographer she was getting into her most creative years.

>We both wanted to show our farms to each other. I was about to go to London with Sean at the time. “Mine first, then,” Linda said. So Sean and I were invited to her farm. I say Linda’s farm, because you really felt Linda’s energy there - you just knew that she was the one who had created this environment for her husband and their children. There was something very real about the way they lived. They weren’t surrounded by servants or anything. And it was wonderful. Linda had horses and sheep - it was a working farm, not a manicured estate.

>She and her children were doing things together. Seeing them with Sean was great. Hopefully, our children will be wiser than us.

>What I noticed with sadness was that Paul and Linda’s children were living with the pain of what their mother went through. Their mother was attacked by the world and for a long time not recognized for her achievements. Everything that was good was considered the work of her husband, and everything the public did not approve of was considered her doing. I didn’t hear any of this from Linda. But when I met her children and saw how protective they were of their mother, I felt the pain of their knowledge that the world was not always kind to her.

>When I heard of her illness, my first instinct was to share that with the fans at the concert I was giving in London and to pray together. But, of course, I couldn’t. So I dedicated the concert to “a friend in England who has been taken ill.” “Names!” they shouted. “No names!” I shouted back. That’s how it was. We were no-name friends.

>The last conversation I had with her was in January this year. She sounded like the usual powerful and energetic Linda. I thought she had beaten the disease.

>Linda and I did not meet up and have coffee and muffins in a corner cafe or anything like that. But we communicated. We communicated in deeds more than in words. When she was strong, I felt strong. She took a sad song and made it better. Her commitment to vegetarianism and animal rights brought her message to a wider audience than that of rock & roll. But her most important contributions were all made in private. Just like so many women before her, she made a difference in silence. It was nice to know you, Linda.

>With love,  
Yoko",I thought he was supposed to be a vegetarian,"""It's behind me isn't it?""",This is what really happened in room 101,Me and who?,Zombie Paul,,,,"Came across this nice write up by Yoko shortly after Linda passed.

>The first time I met Linda was at one of the Beatles’ recording sessions. Paul introduced her to us. She was attractive, obviously—she had a sunshine smile—but I thought that there was a certain vulnerability about her. Later I came to understand that that impression was wrong, because when I think of Linda’s life, I think of a very strong woman.

>One day, around the time of that first meeting, Paul brought in to the studio some photographs of Linda in New York, in front of the building where she grew up. She was wearing a camel coat and a white scarf, just looking casual and glancing around. That is the Linda I remember from that time.

>During the Beatles’ sessions, Linda and I quickly learned that our husbands were not all buddy-buddy. John and Paul were both talented but very strong-willed people. There was some tension there. Linda and I left them alone. But we didn’t go chummy-chummy, wink-wink, “Aren’t they silly boys?” either. We both stood by our men. That was how we were.

>Then came the Beatles’ breakup. The world blamed it on Linda and me. The attack was like a storm. I think the fans needed a scapegoat, and they chose us! We both had the love and protection of our husbands. Linda had that very much from Paul. But still, it could not have been easy for her.

>The long years after the breakup were not easy, either. John and Paul were not talking. John and I would play Paul’s latest Wings record in our kitchen. John would say some nice things. He couldn’t say it to Paul, but when Paul was not around, John would say nice things about Paul. When Paul and Linda got a farm in Scotland, John said, “That’s Linda. She’s good for him.”

>Was the ice finally starting to melt? In the late Seventies, Paul and Linda came to visit us a few times in New York. In a fine old Liverpool tradition, the two guys did most of the talking, and we sat beside them as Paul held Linda’s hand and John held mine. It was nice to see the guys talk after all those years, even if a little stiffness existed between them.

>After John’s passing, Sean and I started to receive Linda’s beautiful calendar every year. We felt her warmth; and as a photographer she was getting into her most creative years.

>We both wanted to show our farms to each other. I was about to go to London with Sean at the time. “Mine first, then,” Linda said. So Sean and I were invited to her farm. I say Linda’s farm, because you really felt Linda’s energy there - you just knew that she was the one who had created this environment for her husband and their children. There was something very real about the way they lived. They weren’t surrounded by servants or anything. And it was wonderful. Linda had horses and sheep - it was a working farm, not a manicured estate.

>She and her children were doing things together. Seeing them with Sean was great. Hopefully, our children will be wiser than us.

>What I noticed with sadness was that Paul and Linda’s children were living with the pain of what their mother went through. Their mother was attacked by the world and for a long time not recognized for her achievements. Everything that was good was considered the work of her husband, and everything the public did not approve of was considered her doing. I didn’t hear any of this from Linda. But when I met her children and saw how protective they were of their mother, I felt the pain of their knowledge that the world was not always kind to her.

>When I heard of her illness, my first instinct was to share that with the fans at the concert I was giving in London and to pray together. But, of course, I couldn’t. So I dedicated the concert to “a friend in England who has been taken ill.” “Names!” they shouted. “No names!” I shouted back. That’s how it was. We were no-name friends.

>The last conversation I had with her was in January this year. She sounded like the usual powerful and energetic Linda. I thought she had beaten the disease.

>Linda and I did not meet up and have coffee and muffins in a corner cafe or anything like that. But we communicated. We communicated in deeds more than in words. When she was strong, I felt strong. She took a sad song and made it better. Her commitment to vegetarianism and animal rights brought her message to a wider audience than that of rock & roll. But her most important contributions were all made in private. Just like so many women before her, she made a difference in silence. It was nice to know you, Linda.

Suggested albums:

1. Abbey Road
2. Revolver
3. Sgt. PepperSince you asked for “essential” and not “best,” (I think there’s a difference) here’s what I’d say (also I’m increasing to 15 because they have so many essential songs that even 15 feels like I’m short changing them):

I Saw Her Standing There

She Loves You

A Hard Days Night

Can’t Buy Me Love

Help

Yesterday

Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)

Day Tripper

Tomorrow Never Knows

I Am The Walrus

9. “Get Back”

10. “Abbey Road Medley”","I've never listened to the Beatles, what 10 beginner essential songs would you recommend?Just listen to the Red/Blue compilation albums, they’ve got a nice summation of the essential tracks, they’re very well put together.i quite agree with the Chronological guide previously commented, but its worth remembering The Beatles put a lot of focus into their albums as full pieces of art, so you ought to check some of them out.

you honestly cant go wrong with any album post-Help!, but The White Album might be a bit tough to digest for a new listener. my personal favs are Revolver, Sgt. Pepper’s, and Abbey Road.In chronological order:

I Saw Her Standing There

All My Loving

Help!

Yesterday

Eleanor Rigby

Tomorrow Never Knows

A Day in the Life

Revolution

Something

When I pick up a guitar, one of my go tos to start strumming is Norwegian Wood. I also love the guitar part to get back, the solos are really pretty easy but so satisfying to nail.

On bass, my go to is Oh! Darling or Help.Piano: Martha My Dear, Piggies, The Long And Winding Road

Guitar: Blackbird, Mother Natures Son, Helter Skelter

Drums: anyLess than an amateur guitar player here, but I did manage to figure out and play the guitar solo from *Michele*Here Comes The Sun is my favorite.Martha My Dear on piano. Makes me feel like MozartMy band always includes ""Helter Skelter"" at our halloween shows. I get to play guitar on that, and it is absolutely wonderful to really let it all hang out, full distortion and feedback, plus - I get to shout Ringo's line to end the song, It's such a joy. Every once in a while I just start the riff at practice, just to see if the crew will join, and mostly they do, if I don't do it very often.I mean they are all great. I can tell you one that changed my mind about it once I played it. ""Fool On The Hill,"" I used to despise that song, found it treacly and uninteresting. Turns out that it just needed to be played on piano and not tooted out on a flute, I really changed my mind about that after playing it.

There are some ones that are fun, ""Here Comes the Sun,"" is a blast on ukulele.

What I love about John's stuff, is he has this trick, where he finds a chord and then picks a note in that chord to move up and down the fret or key board. Xmas or my favorite version of it Instant Karma, that one's a blast on piano.

Michelle is super interesting on guitar you can tell Paul was just showing off with the chord changes and inversions and so on.

That run on I dig a pony is so fun on guitar.

Let it be and imagine are just fun chunka chunka songs on piano.I play guitar and drums. Intermediate on both. In drums I love playing Please Please Me, Rain, Hey Bulldog, plenty more. Guitar go to stuff would be Get Back, I Saw Her Standing There, Taxman, I Feel Fine."

Sam Okell who went through the tapes and did most of the actual technical remixing for the 2017 remixes said it was Paul. He listed the ahhs as “Paul’s vocals.”

Especially with Paul. But that is what makes music so timeless.'Play it cool' can mean you are trying to look calm, unemotional, or just not interested.

I've always thought it meant to not be cynical or distrustful of relationships. To 'make your world colder' means to be shut off from others. I think that he wrote this song when he had met the love of his life Linda Eastman.

On a side note, he wrote the song for Julian after his parents broke up, but I think he could also be writing to his own younger self - especially after the experience of losing his mother at a young age. You can then be afraid of becoming close to someone else, for fear of losing them as well, and in those days there wasn't the same kind of support there is now. Paul didn't seem to give up his optimism however and in the end I think he found support in his relationship with Linda."

14. Let It Be - Bill WithersI can't think of any covers of Beatles songs that I find superior to the original.Personal favorite is Yellow Magic Orchestra’s cover of Day Tripper. Often reach for it over the OG

They even manage to sneak the day tripper riff in thereSiouxsie and the Banshees version of Dear Prudence.I always preferred the dreamy, exotic version of “The Fool on the Hill” by Sergio Mendes and Brazil ‘66.I really like the B-52s cut of Paperback Writer","What’s some Beatles songs that you think the cover version is better?This may be a hot take but I prefer Stevie Wonder’s version of We can work it outStevie Wonder’s “We Can Work it Out” is fantastic, even if I hesitate calling it better since the original is outstanding as well.Earth Wind and Fire did a great job “Gotta Get You Into My Life”.

Donny Hathaway does a great Jealous Guy (solo Lennon song).Mama's and the Papas ""I Call Your Name"", hands down.Well, none. But...

Being a teen girl and liking the Beatles,"I have been a massive Beatles fan for ten years, I have spent hundreds of dollars on vinyl, cds, books ect and have spent hours reading and watching interviews, documentaries, articles, videos. I have listened to all of their discography, even have downloaded music not on spotify so I can listen to it. They are literally apart of my life but I feel the moment that the fact I am a teen girl is recognized, all my work is invalidated. I am not just saying this based on feelings, I have experienced this first hand and I also don’t think it’s all fans that aren’t like me that act this way. But I have been told that the sole reason that someone wouldn’t trust something I told them was because I was a teenage girl with a Beatles account. Wow. I am not a big tiktoker or an influencer by any means, I have 1000 followers with some well liked videos but I don’t make posts only about how hot they are (nothing wrong with doing so) or how I wish I could date them, I mostly post Beatles history things, music things or my collection of merchandise.

It bothers me that for since forever, teenage girls interests are pushed down because they are teenage girls. I feel insecure and unwelcome in Beatles spaces outside my bubble because of something I can’t change. I wish there was more female or queer beatles creators, and the ones that do get attention tend to also be taken less seriously. I don’t see people ever talk about this at all which sucks because there is so much misogyny in the music community. I still will be open and proud of liking the band and the way I get treated won’t make me talk or like them any less but it still bothers me because without teen girls, the Beatles wouldn’t be as rich or as known.",beatles,346,Ok_Complex_9200,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7b14b82fbcd0>,"Rant!

It’s a shame you feel on the outs with the music community. 

If it helps, the Beatles’ popularity with teen girls in the 60s was something that had never really been seen before.  It was a massively big thing, it was a sea change in popular music and in society at large.  All of the sudden, there was POWER in “teen girls” that had never been seen before.  These were women with families, and money, and they accepted the Beatles, and all they stood for, in a way that just couldn’t be denied.  These women werent’ outcasts, or weirdos, they were just women, who all of the sudden had the power to raise whoever they liked up to new levels of popularity.  It changed pop music (and society) forever.  These days female singers and musicians are some of the most popular people on the planet.  In the 50s, that couldn’t have happened.  The Beatles changed all that.  Hell, most of their early covers were songs by “girl groups”!  It’s not a coincidence that the 70s was when women like Carole King and Joni Mitchell became famous performers and songwriters.  It was even better in the 80s, when artists like Kate Bush and Annie Lennox became superstars.  Nowadays it’s Taylor Swift.  Beyoncé just did a Beatles cover; she knows where it all came from.  It was the Beatles and their female fans that made that possible.  

Honestly, the fact that you “get” them even at your age, in this century, kind of makes me think you might be a bit of a prodigy.  The Beatles aren’t “old music” to you; you understand their appeal right now.  That’s amazing!  And I think your love of their work is justified; every generation discovers them eventually, you just got there first in yours!

Be proud of your love for the Beatles!  They certainly appreciated the “teen girls” who loved them.  My sister and I have been Beatles fanatics for almost 60 years.  We feel you!","I remember listening to a special ""J Files"" on the Beatles   on JJJ a ""youth"" radio station in Aus. They had a quiz and I remember the call in contestant absolutely nailed it with quick rapid fire answers. Like she was an absolute savant on the topic.

You are completely correct!

I was a teen girl when I got into them in the 90’s. I didn’t spend as much as you but ONLY because I didn’t have much access to money. I spent most of what I did earn on Beatles CDs and books. We didn’t have streaming then or the internet so tracking down stuff that wasn’t current and licensed was hard. So my collection was meager by today’s standards, but I got my little sister into them too and we were just as into it as anyone in the 60’s could have been, I would think. As the Anthologies came out we were SO HYPED, it was like the tradition of teen girls standing outside the music store squealing was being carried on. 

Now I am an oldgirl Beatles fan but it makes ME, for one, super happy to know there are still teengirl fans coming. It’s like some kind of torch being passed, an ancient tradition of teen girls scratching ‘I 💜 Beatles’ and ‘Mrs (insert favorite Beatle here)’ on the modern equivalent of their Trapper Keepers. HECK YEAH. Like you and I and a teen girl who comes after you and a teen girl that came before us are part of some kind of unbroken chain of teen girls loving the lads from Liverpool across eras.

I’m not crying, you are!!

Anyway, pay no mind to what the small minds think. The lads wouldn’t, right? People are always going to have different opinions and you’ll still be exposed to a lot of that here, but I haven’t noticed a whole lot of ‘teen girls who like the Beatles are lesser than’. Imma be gatekeepy for a minute and say that I feel like someone who genuinely loves a thing (ie the band) WANTS new people to discover them and love them too. A real fan should be proud of the guys that what they did is so amazing that it still attracts people and that it speaks to such a wide variety of minds. There’s no way Paul and Ringo would tell you you’re not wanted if you met them today. 

I know it’s a bummer but don’t let it get you. (You haven’t yet, I’m just saying) Lots of us were teen girls and didn’t let it go bowing to some random’s power trip. They can miss us with that. I’m so glad I still can love the things I loved as a kid and a teen. Life is very short and there’s no time for fussing and fighting, my friend!

So my collection was meager by today’s standards, but I got my little sister into them too and we were just as into it as anyone in the 60’s could have been, I would think. As the Anthologies came out we were SO HYPED, it was like the tradition of teen girls standing outside the music store squealing was being carried on. 

Now I am an oldgirl Beatles fan but it makes ME, for one, super happy to know there are still teengirl fans coming. It’s like some kind of torch being passed, an ancient tradition of teen girls scratching ‘I 💜 Beatles’ and ‘Mrs (insert favorite Beatle here)’ on the modern equivalent of their Trapper Keepers. HECK YEAH. Like you and I and a teen girl who comes after you and a teen girl that came before us are part of some kind of unbroken chain of teen girls loving the lads from Liverpool across eras.

I’m not crying, you are!!

Anyway, pay no mind to what the small minds think. The lads wouldn’t, right? People are always going to have different opinions and you’ll still be exposed to a lot of that here, but I haven’t noticed a whole lot of ‘teen girls who like the Beatles are lesser than’. Imma be gatekeepy for a minute and say that I feel like someone who genuinely loves a thing (ie the band) WANTS new people to discover them and love them too. A real fan should be proud of the guys that what they did is so amazing that it still attracts people and that it speaks to such a wide variety of minds. There’s no way Paul and Ringo would tell you you’re not wanted if you met them today. 

I know it’s a bummer but don’t let it get you. (You haven’t yet, I’m just saying) Lots of us were teen girls and didn’t let it go bowing to some random’s power trip. They can miss us with that. I’m so glad I still can love the things I loved as a kid and a teen. Life is very short and there’s no time for fussing and fighting, my friend! I for one am happy you are here."

Which gave me the idea that the song was already in existence when he heard that interview, and inspired him to take the song down a different path.

Paul: Sgt Pepper. Completely his concept and ideation. He basically designed the most famous record ever.

George: Revolver. George has more tracks on this one and he leads off with Taxman, which is a banger.

Ringo: Abbey Road. I like Octopus' Garden and his most famous drum work is probably his solo on the medley.

Just for Sgt Pepper in particular you have John and Paul working together at least in part on most of the songs (With a little help, Getting Better, She’s Leaving Home, Lucy, Mr Kite, A Day in the Life, When I’m 64, Lovely Rita) with the remaining songs obviously featuring arrangement contributions from all members for the most part.   

Regardless of who originated the idea, I don’t consider any LP until the White Album to have truly individual “John” or “Paul” songs to a significant degree. Up til then it was rare for them not to at least bounce there ideas off of each other, and even as late as the Get Back project they were still meeting up for songwriting sessions.","For me it's as follows:

Ringo: Abbey Road. I like Octopus' Garden and his most famous drum work is probably his solo on the medley.

  
Also, it's worth noting that, with the exception of George, the album I think is each Beatle's best is actually their favourite. George's favourite was Rubber Soul, not Revolver.George - Abbey Road

Lennon/McCartney's Beatles for sale. (though i love A Hard Day's Night as My favourite i love i like it as a whole thing rather than Lp thing albeit the whole album is credited to Lennon/McCartney, the full work is pure Lennon an pure McCartney then mixed together for contract for example ""and i love her"" is actually McCartney/Harrison so yeah, speaking about true colaborations in between legendary duo Beatles for sale did better workThe earlier albums up to and including Sgt Pepper are more collaborative than they are generally acknowledged to be. Just for Sgt Pepper in particular you have John and Paul working together at least in part on most of the songs (With a little help, Getting Better, She’s Leaving Home, Lucy, Mr Kite, A Day in the Life, When I’m 64, Lovely Rita) with the remaining songs obviously featuring arrangement contributions from all members for the most part.   

Regardless of who originated the idea, I don’t consider any LP until the White Album to have truly individual “John” or “Paul” songs to a significant degree. Up til then it was rare for them not to at least bounce there ideas off of each other, and even as late as the Get Back project they were still meeting up for songwriting sessions.","Which album do you think is each beatle’s best?I’ll go first. I think John’s songwriting absolutely peaked with the white album. Dear prudence, i’m so tired, glass onion, happiness is a warm gun, all amazing. For Paul, i’m split between revolver and abbey road. Paul’s love songs on revolver (here, there, everywhere, for no one) are some of the best the band has produced, but his hits on abbey road like oh! darling and you never give me your money are spectacular. I think george is also abbey road. His guitar playing on octopus is fantastic, and here comes the sun is a classic. He is obviously amazing on the white album as well. Ringo is either let it be or abbey road. Both albums have some amazing drumming, and octopuses garden is a genuinely great song. What do yall think? Edit: as some comments have added, george is also great on revolver. totally slipped my mindFor me it's as follows:

John: White Album. Lots of stripped-down rock, which is what he loved.

Paul: Sgt Pepper. Completely his concept and ideation. He basically designed the most famous record ever.

George: Revolver. George has more tracks on this one and he leads off with Taxman, which is a banger.

Ringo: Abbey Road. I like Octopus' Garden and his most famous drum work is probably his solo on the medley.

But if you remove Paul´s part I think it would risk becoming a bit boring. I think it would need an interesting modulation (a key change). Lennon was of course very good at modulations, so maybe he could´ve pulled it off. 'Something' by George is a good example of a song that risked becoming boring but with multiple modulations, particularly the middle 8 one injects alot of energy. It made it a dynamic song. 

Paul´s part is not my type of music, but the contrast with Lennon´s part adds alot to the dynamics of the song, and it enchances Lennon´s part. If Paul were to create a complete song out of his part he probably would´ve combined it with another song, added some modulations etc. Late in the Beatles and in his solo career he really liked combining songs, switching between styles mid-song.","The question is moot, as the song works so well BECAUSE of the two parts. The whimsical, light hearted bit by Paul starkly contrasts the John parts, which creates a very interesting dynamic and tension. John is singing about heavy stuff that (albeit a bit abstract) that happens every day, while Paul is just describing an every day situation. They play off each other very well. Separating them would lower the impact of both parts significantly, even if built out more.","John’s part is basically a complete song if you include the orchestra swells, Paul’s bit is only about 30 seconds long.","It’s the vocalised aahs after Paul’s part transitioning to John’s part which lifts the song to greatness. I’m not sure who composed that part. In other words, the song cannot be split. ","If Paul developed his into a full song, it would probably sound something he’d do in Ram. Have a normal verse then go into this whimsy section “Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head”. John in the other hand I think would’ve still done something special. John even said in the end of his life interview that he didn’t know what to do as he’d be forcing a middle eight. Knowing John, he wouldn’t force it, and try something cool. Maybe he’d add a revolution 9 esque part in the middle?

Unfortunately all the newspaper clippings inside were falling out (as the tape holding everything together is roughly 60 years old!) BUT within this scrapbook, I found tons of cool Beatles artifacts (ranging from 1963-1968) INCLUDING a ticket stub from their show at the maple leaf gardens in 1965 and another stub from their last appearance in Canada (also at the gardens) from 1966! I love collecting Canadian-related rock memorabilia and reading through the Beatles history with Canada from their rise to fame here to their last and supposedly “dull” concert (according to newspaper articles after the concert) was truly a treat! For anyone who doubts the hysterical effect that the Beatles had on the world in the mid 60s, go read old newspaper articles reporting on their concert appearances! I’m grateful to own these pieces of rock n roll history and I doubt I’ll be topping this find anytime soon :)I immediately recognized the ticket stubs as being from Maple Leaf Gardens.

Nice find!That Ticket to Ride 45 was my first introduction to the Beatles. Blew my mind, and the BSIde “Yes it Is” is still up there."

280,1713244714.0,Having a hard time adjusting to post AHDN albums ,"So I’m a pretty new Beatles fan. I absolutely love the first album. Second album is good but definitely weaker than the first. The third album just blew my socks off. Months later it’s now one of my favorite albums of all time. I was thinking “how can they top this”. So I listen to Beatles For Sale and…I hated it. Long story short, I’ve listened to it many times now. I still don’t care for it but it does have some great songs on it. No Reply was a grower but I love it now. I’ll Follow the Sun is amazing. But other than those two, I don’t care for most of the album. I don’t like Bob Dylan, never have, so all that folk/country stuff is a major turn off for me. I can’t stand it. Unfortunately, this trend continued on the fifth album, Help. It’s better than Beatles For Sale, but I’m still not a huge fan of it. Way too many folk/country stuff on there. Title track is ok, I Need You is good, Ticket to Ride is fine, Yesterday is good but I’ll Follow the Sun is a better version of it, Tell Me What You See is the only song on the album that I think is great, it made me cry. But that’s one song out of fourteen. Where’s the emotion? Where’s the Beatles that I love? I Saw Her Standing There, Do You Wanna Know a Secret, There’s a Place, All My Loving, Money (That’s What I Want), A Hard Day’s Night, I Should Have Known Better, And I Love Her, Any Time At All, Things We Said Today, etc…where did this band go? The vocal harmonies, the raw emotion? I gave Rubber Soul a spin and…it was fine, better than the last two, but it’s not the band that I know and love. They sound tired. They’re not as energetic and expressive. I’m not getting the feels anymore. The first three albums gave me so much emotion that some songs would make me cry. What’s going on? They turned into a Bob Dylan type band, they seem more concerned with making a country/folk song than they do with writing catchy songs with a lot of emotion.

Should I continue? Should I listen to Revolver?

From 1966 on they got pretty eclectic and did psych, hard rock, folk, music hall, and even easy listening orchestral stuff! But also a lot of piano-driven pop rock too. 

I greatly prefer Revolver to Rubber Soul and find it to be the best album they had done since ADHN. It's much more diverse and psychedelic though.

They rarely returned to those early 60s 2-minute ""straight to the hook"" simple arrangements that you connected with. 

By simple I don't suggest anything around the quality of those early songs, btw, I mean the fact they were pretty much *live* in their recordings at that time. 

As time goes on they become much more complex and experimental and I don't think you'll like it. At the time it wasn't an unusual feeling for a lot of early fans (my mom never really loved them after HDN whilst my dad never really liked them before....)","This is super interesting, because there were a decent amount of people in 1965-1966 who thought Rubber Soul was a negative follow for the Beatles, and a detour from their sound. They thought they sounded sad. 

I couldn’t disagree more when you say they’re not as expressive here. Songs like You Won’t See Me and I’m Looking Through are detailed and heartfelt pleas, complaints in a troubled relationship, eloquently laying out the author’s thoughts. 

Nowhere Man lays bare the insecurity and melancholy and almost depressive frustration of a man who is going through the motions. 

In My Life is the pretty much the most poetic love song they ever wrote. 

You mentioned harmonies. This album is filled with them. Energy? It’s all over the place, the riff on The Word, or on rockers Drive My Car. The instrumentation is increasingly complex in comparison to previous albums, with more nuanced and intricate layers.

Now granted it’s not quite the same rock and roll from A Hard Day’s Night, so I get what you’re saying. But sadness is also a human emotion, and in my opinion it’s expressed beautifully in this album. There’s regret, longing, love, realization. It might be masked with passiveness at times, but I view that as an illusion. 

As for Revolver, some of the most beautiful lyrics, harmonies, and melodies in songwriting history are on that very album, so I’d be hard pressed not to recommend it. It’s still very different from A Hard Day’s Night, but it’s not folksy like Help or Rubber Soul. Instead, it delves more into classical music, Indian influences, and psychedelia.

1. Early = PPM - AHDN
2. Middle = BFS - RS
3. Psychedelic = Revolver - MMT + Yellow Sub
4. Late = White Album - LIB

Most fans prefer a certain period. You might be an ""early"" guy. The emphasis on their ""great works"" or ""masterpieces"" is concentrated on their later stuff. 

I think that emphasis is misplaced. 

The early stuff gets downgraded by some because they are 2 - 3 minute pop songs. Some of the greatest songs ever written are pop songs. And if pop is short for popular...who's more popular than The Beatles?

Here's something for you...I prefer AHDN over Sgt Pepper.

Try the different periods, though. If your mind is open you'll really enjoy the ride!","Well, it was the same for me actually. Matter of fact I was perfectly happy with just listening until Help!. I hated Revolver and I didn't like Rubber Soul. Sgt Pepper sounded too weird in my ears and I turned it off immediately. Avant Garde music just relies on your state of mind and how you are. Over time, out of nowhere, that song appealed to me after around a year. Sgt Pepper came like I got shot in the head. Revolver started making a whole lot of sense. Rubber Soul strikes me down. Look, when you become older in terms of how introspective you become, or your life experiences, a lot of songs start making sense. You can never like a song as deep or ""weird"" as later Beatles albums if you don't relate or understand how or what they feel.

When you feel depressed, utterly depressed and you actually feel you're fucked in life, Nowhere Man and I'm A Loser makes 1000x more sense. When you feel like you don't like this world and you were in your own imaginary realms of reality, Strawberry Fields makes way more sense and the ""weird"" all add up because ""nothing is real"". When you place the situations going on in the world as reasons as to why you aren't happy, and it all becomes so overwhelming because there are a million reasons to be unhappy if you just look at the state of the world, A Day In The Life makes way way way more sense. If you are into imagination along with blues and rock and roll, the late White Album, Abbey Road, and Let It Be makes sense.

If you don't like it, it's fine. Music is subjective. The Beatles lost many many fans after Help! because of that and it's not their fault or The Beatles' fault. That was just simply music. Their mood fluctuated, their perspectives on life changed. Their feeling of happiness because of fame faded away, they were more melancholic, less rock and roll, and more introspective, hence their music becoming the way it is. It ain't your fault that you don't like it, it's just who you are. Music tells a lot about who we are as people, and you're into straightforward relatable music that don't leave a lot of room for interpretation but broad enough so you can relate it to your life.

And you love charm and self assurance. Who doesn't?","From Rubber Soul onwards they change pretty drastically with every album. They don't continue to sound folky/dylan-esque, but they also don't sound like their early albums. But they are also not so revered for their early albums, it's the later albums that made them the greatest band of all time rather than just the most popular. 

If you are short on time, listen to the red and blue compilation albums for the best cuts. You should also listen to Past Masters, which contains singles not released on albums.

The early stuff gets downgraded by some because they are 2 - 3 minute pop songs. Some of the greatest songs ever written are pop songs. And if pop is short for popular...who's more popular than The Beatles?

Here's something for you...I prefer AHDN over Sgt Pepper.

Try the different periods, though. If your mind is open you'll really enjoy the ride!Well, it was the same for me actually. Matter of fact I was perfectly happy with just listening until Help!. I hated Revolver and I didn't like Rubber Soul. Sgt Pepper sounded too weird in my ears and I turned it off immediately. Avant Garde music just relies on your state of mind and how you are. Over time, out of nowhere, that song appealed to me after around a year. Sgt Pepper came like I got shot in the head. Revolver started making a whole lot of sense. Rubber Soul strikes me down. Look, when you become older in terms of how introspective you become, or your life experiences, a lot of songs start making sense. You can never like a song as deep or ""weird"" as later Beatles albums if you don't relate or understand how or what they feel.

When you feel depressed, utterly depressed and you actually feel you're fucked in life, Nowhere Man and I'm A Loser makes 1000x more sense. When you feel like you don't like this world and you were in your own imaginary realms of reality, Strawberry Fields makes way more sense and the ""weird"" all add up because ""nothing is real"". When you place the situations going on in the world as reasons as to why you aren't happy, and it all becomes so overwhelming because there are a million reasons to be unhappy if you just look at the state of the world, A Day In The Life makes way way way more sense. If you are into imagination along with blues and rock and roll, the late White Album, Abbey Road, and Let It Be makes sense.

If you don't like it, it's fine. Music is subjective. The Beatles lost many many fans after Help! because of that and it's not their fault or The Beatles' fault. That was just simply music. Their mood fluctuated, their perspectives on life changed. Their feeling of happiness because of fame faded away, they were more melancholic, less rock and roll, and more introspective, hence their music becoming the way it is. It ain't your fault that you don't like it, it's just who you are. Music tells a lot about who we are as people, and you're into straightforward relatable music that don't leave a lot of room for interpretation but broad enough so you can relate it to your life.

And you love charm and self assurance. Who doesn't?From Rubber Soul onwards they change pretty drastically with every album. They don't continue to sound folky/dylan-esque, but they also don't sound like their early albums. But they are also not so revered for their early albums, it's the later albums that made them the greatest band of all time rather than just the most popular. 

If you are short on time, listen to the red and blue compilation albums for the best cuts. You should also listen to Past Masters, which contains singles not released on albums. There are a lot of great early songs on it."

Since Yellow Submarine sort of ruins their later year flow and Magical Mystery Tour isnt a true album and more of a compilation This is just silly.[deleted]Rubber soul, Revolver, Sgt Pepper, MMT, White AlbumEven a “weaker” Beatles album still literally and objectively helped rewrite the rules for 20th century music.  Sure, maybe you don’t love Beatles for Sale or whatever, but taken in the context in which it was released, it was mind-blowing stuff.  This is the one of the easiest “yes, they meet this criteria” questions you could ask.Please please me 



With the Beatles 



A hard day’s night 



Beatles for sale 



Help!



Nailed the criteria with the first 5 and then got better from that point onwards.I think it's more than fair to disqualify Yellow Submarine on the grounds that:

1. Half of it are George Martin tracks *published under the name George Martin*
2. It only had 4 original songs

If I recall correctly a rule of the 5 albums test is you don't count collaborations, so point 1 alone takes it out because it has songs by a separate artist.

Then it's really easy because you have Rubber Soul - Revolver - Sgt. Pepper's - The Beatles - Abbey road, which has to be **the** five album run.PPM-LIB. I think they exceeded the testRubber Soul

Revolver

Sgt. Pepper’s 

the white album 

Abbey RoadI don’t care what ground rules are laid out. Any “test” that doesn’t result in the Beatles being the best artist is irrelevant.I would not say Yellow Submarine breaks it since it's more a compilation since it only has 4 new songs from 1967/8 that were released in 1969, and the Magical Mystery Tour LP was not released in the UK in 1967. If you wanna include that I guess you'd have to go by the other US albums or just count the EP.

It's like arguing with a brick wall. Those who know, know. That includes almost every successful rock drummer who's made a name for themselves since about 1966 onwards.

Is he a *technical* master? No. None of the Beatles were. But anyone who's been in a band will tell you, amazing bands don't make great music with a shit drummer. He fit what they needed and you could argue he pioneered the drummer *being a part of the band* as opposed to just the guy in the back who keeps time.

He sat on a high rise behind the band, he played match grip, he had eccentric and creative fills, he played *for* the singer/song. I could write you an essay with 100 reasons why your friends are wrong.

Off the top of my head:

Oh! Darling (or anything off of Abbey Road)

Ticket to Ride

Rain

Hey Jude (seriously go listen to some isolated drums)

A Day in the Life

Day Tripper

Help! (sounds simple, not easy to replicate)

Does anyone believe that Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds is actually not about LSD (everyone in the beatles that has spoken on it seems to deny it and claim the abbreviation to be a coincidence)?

[deleted]The Beatles have always been extremely open about both their drug use and the drug references in their songs (e.g., ""Got to Get You Into My Life""). Why would John — the brutally frank John Lennon! — suddenly become uncharacteristically coy about this one song? I believe him when he says it's coincidence, especially when he has produced the actual picture Julian drew, and it's even been established exactly who Julian's classmate Lucy is who inspired his drawing. [https://www.beatlesbible.com/2009/10/01/lucy-vodden-who-inspired-lucy-in-the-sky-with-diamonds-dies/](https://www.beatlesbible.com/2009/10/01/lucy-vodden-who-inspired-lucy-in-the-sky-with-diamonds-dies/)Paul came up with the “Turn You On” lyric in A Day in the Life, not John. 

Turning someone on was a much more used phrase in the sixties and wasn’t exclusively sexual like it is now. It was more so used in relation to opening/expanding your mind (often via drugs) or introducing someone to a new idea or inspiring someone. 

Also Paul wrote or contributed a lot of the lyrics in Lucy, “Newspaper Taxis…” specifically was his lineJohn loved wordplay. Sometimes, the words mean absolutely nothing, especially when people started interpreting them. From Beatles Bible...

""According to Lennon’s childhood friend Pete Shotton, he was further inspired to turn the song into a nonsense tour-de-force after receiving a letter from Stephen Bayley, a pupil at his old primary school Quarry Bank. The letter revealed that a teacher was having his class analyse Beatles lyrics.

Lennon asked Shotton to remind him of a playground rhyme they’d known from childhood:

'Yellow matter custard, green slop pie, all mixed together with a dead dog’s eye. Slap it on a butty, ten foot thick. Then wash it all down with a cup of cold sick.'

This became “Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog’s eye”, followed by a stream of mostly meaningless nonsense. 'Let the fuckers work that one out,' was his response to Shotton when he’d finished.""I suggest reading “in his own write” and “ Spaniard in the works”  - they give great insight into how John’s mind riffs on language sounds and ideas. I’ve noticed I have something slightly similar (with far less interesting results) where everything I hear turns into a dad joke; maybe it’s quite common to a degree. JL’s was far more abstract but you still see the connections. Re: Come Together: The claim that apparently has been around for a while but that I only recently encountered (and I don't see on Genius) is that each verse is about a different Beatle: George is the ""holy roller"" with ""hair down to his knees"", Ringo ""shoots Coca Cola"" as opposed to anything harder, John is ""Bag Production"" with ""Ono sideboard"", Paul is ""good looking"" and ""so hard to see"". The other lyrics may or may not be in-jokes or more cryptic references, or perhaps the whole idea is bogus. But as a very long-time Beatles fan it was interesting to hear this apparently well-known interpretation for the first time.[deleted]There is an extensive treatment of “Come Together” on Genius.In a 1988 interview with [Neil Strauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Strauss), Leary said the slogan was ""given to him"" by [Marshall McLuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan) during a lunch in New York City. Leary added McLuhan ""was very much-interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that's a lot,' to the tune of a [Pepsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#Rise) commercial of the time. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.'""[^(\[1\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_on,_tune_in,_drop_out#cite_note-1) The phrase was used by Leary in a speech he delivered at the opening of a [press conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_conference) in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City) on September 19, 1966. It urged people to embrace cultural changes through the use of [psychedelics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug) by detaching from the existing conventions and hierarchies in society. It was also the motto of his [League for Spiritual Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_for_Spiritual_Discovery).[^(\[2\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_on,_tune_in,_drop_out#cite_note-2)

In his speech, Leary said:

>Like every great religion, we seek to find the divinity within and to express this revelation in a life of glorification and the worship of God. These ancient goals we define in the metaphor of the present—turn on, tune in, drop out.

Leary explains in his 1983 autobiography [*Flashbacks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashbacks_(book)):

>""Turn on"" meant go within to activate your neural and genetic equipment. Become sensitive to the many and various levels of consciousness and the specific triggers engaging them. Drugs were one way to accomplish this end. ""Tune in"" meant interact harmoniously with the world around you—externalize, materialize, express your new internal perspectives. ""Drop out"" suggested an active, selective, graceful process of detachment from involuntary or unconscious commitments. ""Drop Out"" meant self-reliance, a discovery of one's singularity, a commitment to mobility, choice, and change. Unhappily, my explanations of this sequence of personal development are often misinterpreted to mean ""Get stoned and abandon all constructive activity"".[^(\[4\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_on,_tune_in,_drop_out#cite_note-4)John wrote ""I Am The Walrus"" for people like OP here."

All the bad events made Paul and George almost absent for those four years.Any thoughts?As someone who has been a Beatles fan since 1964, I'm sure it was worse for them than it was for us. And I'm pretty sure Ringo wasn't exactly enjoying watching his friends suffer and then losing them.I was born in '98, so I wasn't really conscious of all that. I don't even remember 9/11, just how it affected things in the next few years (my Grandma apparently took me for a walk so I didn't have to hear the news coverage.)

And when I did get older and fell in love with the Beatles, at first I mainly thought of the tragedy of John Lennon's death. George and Linda's  deaths to cancer at 58 and 56 at least seemed more natural (albeit still horrible). Like at least they had time to prepare compared to John, and had time to live fuller lives than he did.

At 25 I now realize dying in your mid-late '50s is still tragically young.And to top it all off, we got the song ""Freedom"".

https://youtu.be/HpOwePJdzO0?si=ty46XO7ur3pZl-jiIt was for me. I took George’s death quite badly. He was and is my favourite Beatle. Linda’s death as well. Such a lovely person and Paul was genuinley broken.You have to remember that this was pre-social media and the Internet was in its infancy. We weren't used to having constant access to any and all media and information at the tips of our fingers. So the fact that we had just gotten the official CD releases in 1989, then anthology releases in 94/95 and the ""1"" Album came out in 2000 was still fresh and way more Beatles stuff than anyone who grew up in the post Beatles 70s and 80s ever expected to get. Mostly, it's just sad when you lose your heroes, but I would say it wasn't tough *because* Paul and George were publicly absent, because it's not like they were hugely present (especially George) in earlier years“Actually, it was super easy. Barely an inconvenience.”  - Ryan George

I will always have the music.2000 was one of the most commercially successful years the Beatles ever had, with the *1* compilation topping the charts in numerous countries. 

We also got the 30th anniversary re-release of George's *All Things Must Pass*, his swan-song ""Horse to the Water."" 

Paul McCartney released *Run Devil Run* and *Driving Rain* (an incredibly underrated album), as well as the *Wingspan* compilation and documentary, and several experimental albums like *Working Classical*, *Rushes*, and *Liverpool Sound Collage*. 

Ringo Starr put out the studio album *Vertical Man*, his Christmas album *I Wanna Be Santa Claus*, and live album *VH1 Storytellers*.

We also got the *John Lennon Anthology* box set.

1998 to 2001 was a great time to get into the Beatles, and also happens to be when I got into them.I think it was probably worse for them than it was for the fansWe gathered at Strawberry Fields NYC the day George died.2001 was pretty rough all around, especially the last quarter or so."

The intros to each interview are filled with factual errors, and the interviews themselves all seem rather truncated.

It's probably not a book that would appeal to anyone who doesn't already know a lot about the Beatles' history and all the side characters in their lives. On the other hand, there's obviously value in hearing the direct thoughts of the people involved, most of whom aren't around anymore and some of whom weren't interviewed much when they were. And because most of the interviews (and particularly the ones with Paul and George) were conducted in late 1980 before John died, you get a pretty rare window into how things stood then.

It's probably not a book that would appeal to anyone who doesn't already know a lot about the Beatles' history and all the side characters in their lives. On the other hand, there's obviously value in hearing the direct thoughts of the people involved, most of whom aren't around anymore and some of whom weren't interviewed much when they were. And because most of the interviews (and particularly the ones with Paul and George) were conducted in late 1980 before John died, you get a pretty rare window into how things stood then.

So I guess overall, I would say: it's not a good book, but it is a decent resource for fans and historians who want to collect every scrap of info available.It'll never end, even after they are all deceasedIt's pretty salacious, a good tabloid read. It's enjoyable, though. If you want heavy and dry, read a Lewisohn book or the amazing McCartney Legacy. I have listened to this on Audible, and it's great.

There's a breakup series that presents events with excerpts and evidence (along with lots of fun speculation).","I've just realized The Beatles broke up around the time of Abbey Road, and it has blown my mind.I mean, who does that? At the height of their musical powers, and with so much more to give as a band, they began to disintegrate. Of course, at the time, we all know that things had gotten quite bad among the band members, and I will not mention the details, but with the hindsight of a fan who loves every single aspect of their music, for the first time their break-up does not register as a sad/emotional event for me anymore, but a mind-blowing one instead due to the realization that this was not a band who were getting old, or had lost a member, or who did not have any material left to record, but instead burned bright and hot and went out like a matchstick.They had already been together ten years (thirteen if you include when Paul joined The Quarrymen).

However, if he had been a good dad, John might have grown up a happy, contented Liverpool artist whose parents happily supported his life as a poet and pen & ink artist.

And maybe we’d never have had Beatles.I always thought he looked like a mobster, at least in this photo.https://preview.redd.it/6nctgmiuu2uc1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92a0fd5de9a7605d707317b58a32bcb724f03e5e

from wikipedia's article on the Plastic Ono Band album.To be fair he offered to marry Julia and raise John, but Aunt Mimi told him to piss off.  He did because he knew he was probably incapable of being a good father.  John was better off being raised by his Aunt.  His song was actually pretty good.  John got his looks and voice from the old man.Not my favorite Beatle.He left John, but John never left him."

He dropped the autotune, and is embracing his older voice. It’s most likely still used, but not as obviously, or for effect, to my ears

His upcoming country album has me excited if he continues like this. Imagine if he can use his old man imperfect voice to do something like Johnny Cash covering hurtHoly shit, this…isn’t bad? A bit derivative, but not bad.Really good song!!! Can't wait for the EP!!!My biggest complaint for years was the horrible cornyness of Ringo's autotune that his producer slaps on every song. This is proof he can sing perfectly fine in the same manner he always did. It makes them actually enjoyable to listen toI remember when I was in elementary school, so excited for his new album, obviously I was a big beatles head.

Hello Beatles fans! Ive searched the internet and couldn’t find any “Beatles songs in chronological order” so I’m asking if someone could help and write all the Beatles songs in chronological order in which the songs released. But before you make it can you including these things on the list.
	1.	Can you put the Yellow Submarine songs before the White Album songs because there was the Yellow Submarine movie that came out before the White Album. But you can put Let It Be songs after Abbey Road songs.
	2.	Make sure you include Beatles singles and they are in chronological order.
	3.	Make sure you include Beatles Covers songs 
	4.	You don’t have to use any Anthology songs. You are welcome to include Free as a bird, Real Love and Now and Then at the end of the list

Stems are strictly a DAW concept, and a relatively recent one at that. Mastering engineers don't always receive stems from the mix engineers—they tend to prefer not to, because stem mastering *is* mixing—and stems don't have anything to do with Dolby Atmos.

Atmos mixes cannot be evaluated on a consumer system not just because consumer Atmos is really Dolby MAT (TrueHD plus a metadata layer) and not the discrete object-based format for theatrical presentation, but also because your system's output is a function of how your Atmos decoder interprets, assigns, and down mixes the TrueHD channels to your setup, based on the metadata layer in the Dolby MAT data stream.

I tend to avoid Atmos mixes of music entirely because the primary playback system intended for a music mix is rarely ever Atmos. If the song was not arranged, produced *and recorded* with Atmos in mind, then regardless of whether it was mixed for Atmos or not it will differ from a true spatial recording.  It makes no sense *to me*^(1), therefore, to listen to it in Atmos. In the case of Now and Then, it was composed and arranged with stereo playback being the end goal.

That being said, whatever you choose to do is your prerogative and I'm placing no objective value over the subjective experience... as long as you know A differs from B and don't expect A to be B, which one you prefer is entirely your informed choice, not colored by external factors.

The Beatles were on a package bill that night, as they often were. They generally played for about 30 minutes. I was generous and put together a 42-minute Cavern setlist. I used live recordings as much as I could.

The Beatles Live at The Cavern - August 3, 1963

On August 3, 1963, The Beatles performed for the final time at the legendary Cavern Club. If a time machine existed, I would choose to be there that night. What songs might I have heard?

On the Steve Hoffman blog, there is a list of songs allegedly generated by an early Beatles fan of the songs performed at The Cavern by The Beatles. This list was provided to Bob Woller, the MC at The Cavern. I combined some of these songs with other songs recorded by The Beatles prior to August '63.

The Beatles were on a package bill that night, as they often were. They generally played for about 30 minutes. I was generous and put together a 42-minute Cavern setlist. I used live recordings as much as I could.

After the breakup, the rest of the movie goes on and shows the different parts of their solo careers and personal lives as separate stories, and would finally converge at the end of the movie which would show the Real Love/Free as a Bird sessions and the Beatles playing together for one last time along with John’s vocals.

(My real idea for a Beatles biopic would never get passed though. That is, a movie from the perspective of a little beetle following the guys around their whole lives) Think you got it wrong there dude, my opinion is actually more important. The best way they could do these biopics is to have them shot through the lenses of Mark David Chapman, those guys in Nigeria or somewhere who robbed Paul and Linda, Stabby McStabberson, and Pete Best, who gets to watch the band go on to achieve worldwide stardom.Gotta start in a dark smoky club in black & white in postwar HamburgIf half the movie is about their solo careers then its not really a ""Beatles"" movie, is it?

And we're just going to handle Hamburg, The Cavern and '62 - '65 with a quick montage? Good luck getting fans to go see it, bro.good God, I hope it's not thatLuckily the Beatles are like John F Kennedy; no one has done a true biopic and I like it that way."

482,1712675041.0,old beatles white album w serial number,"hi! i’m not really a collector, but my grandma gave me some of her old vinyls, including this old beatles white album. she didn’t tell me much about it other than she used to kiss the posters/prints of the members that came with the vinyl. both those prints and the big poster thing are still in the vinyl btw. i was curious abt the serial number and if this was any particular pressing or if it’s worth anything? i don’t want to sell it at all and it’s pretty worn since it’s been rotting in a basement for some thirty-forty years. i did a little research on the serial number and found that the “no” symbol before the serial number was commonly found on vinyls with serial numbers above 2 million, but mine is only around 500k. also, i saw peopl saying that the “the beatles” being embossed as it is on this one, means it’s an original pressing? can someone tell me anything about its worth or what any of this means?

495,1712606620.0,John and Yoko in the back garden of Cafe La Fortuna in 1980,"On the day that Cafe La Fortuna opened on the Upper West Side in 1976, business was slow. “We sold one espresso and made exactly 85 cents,” says Richard Urwand, son of the café’s late owners, Alice and Vincent Urwand. “We thought, What the hell did we just do? But I guess someone liked that one espresso enough to tell someone else, and before we knew it, people started coming in.” Eventually, word spread to the two most famous people in the neighborhood (and arguably the entire world): John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who lived a block away at the Dakota.

Cafe La Fortuna, which was best known for its sandwiches and Italian desserts, became the couple’s regular spot. “They used to come in a few times a week, him more than her,” says Urwand. “He would sit at the same table in the back garden, write, and draw on napkins. Sometimes he’d order a sfogliatella or cannoli.” The cover of Lennon’s posthumous 1984 single “Nobody Told Me” features a photo of him and Ono at the café with the former Beatle about to dig into what appears to be a sandwich. They ate breakfast there on the day of his murder in 1980.

Urwand says the pair came to Cafe La Fortuna because the regular customers knew enough not to bother them. They were social with the staff, though. “I remember one time John said he was thinking about going to Florida but he didn’t like it down there because of the mosquitoes. Another time, he and Yoko brought Sean, who was only a couple years old. They had to run out to do something quick, so they put Sean in my lap and said, ‘Hang on to him for a bit. We’ll be right back.’”

Cafe La Fortuna closed in 2008 after the building changed hands and the landlord raised the rent. Alice Urwand died that year, followed by Vincent in 2014. Their son remembers his parents hit it off with John and Yoko and ended up becoming good friends: “Which was funny because my father liked opera. He used to say the Beatles were the devil’s music.”

Forgive me for sounding like a fangirl, but...
Whenever I look at the bois, particularly the more candid photos of them from the mid to late 60s, I feel like I'm looking at old friends, almost brothers, of mine. I can't shake this feeling that theres a deeper connection, but I'm not sure why. It's completely irrational to feel this way, but... These lads from Liverpool presented themselves in such a way that a girl like me feels this way. Maybe it's their legacy, not sure.

Anybody else feel like this? I can't be the only one.Well, I’m a boy….an almost 70 year old boy.

I was in the carseat and the Sun was coming through the window and it was such a wonderful feeling, like euphoric.

The second Beatles song I remember hearing is Yesterday. We used cd players and we only had a few albums at the time since we had just moved. One of the albums we had was Help! After the first time I heard the song, I replayed it like one million times. I’ve always liked feeling a melancholy/sadishh feeling and this song is the first time I can remember feeling that way, so it’s very special to me for that reason.

The isolated vocals without effects prove it was Paul who did the ahhs. Imo, people only think it’s John because of the effects on the vocals, but if you give a fair listen to the isolated tape, it’s obvious it’s Paul. It’s his tone and you can especially hear it in the intro and outro to the ahhhs. I expect to be downvoted by people who don’t want to believe the ahhs aren’t John but it is what it is. 

Sam Okell, who did the actual hands on technical remixing for Sgt Pepper said it was Paul and listed the ahhs as “Paul’s vocals.” 

Additionally Paul has a history of doing vocals like that while John doesn’t, for example the Lovely Rita intro 

Lastly there’s this guy in the link below who says it’s Paul. He does reliable Beatles vocal breakdowns and he is 100% sure it’s Paul

Recently become interested and I'd like to learn more about the history of the beatles.  I've seen a few documentaries about specific albums or tours but I'm looking for something that's a bit higher level.  Anything recommendations for something like that?The Anthology series crushes. Very thorough.This was the first one I saw years ago, it's pretty good and covers all the bases pretty well.   [https://archive.org/details/the-compleat-beatles-1982](https://archive.org/details/the-compleat-beatles-1982)The Compleat Beatles, 1982.""The Beatles Anthology"" is pretty good.Probably just go for the entire anthology series. It’s online you can watch it for free. It’s quite lengthy, but you certainly will understand so much.

# WHY THE BEATLES’ ‘SGT. PEPPER’ MUSICAL BOMBED

[https://ultimateclassicrock.com/beatles-sgt-pepper-musical/](https://ultimateclassicrock.com/beatles-sgt-pepper-musical/)

  
*Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band on the Road: A Rock Spectacle* debuted Off-Broadway at New York’s Beacon Theater on Nov. 17, 1974 with little input from the [Beatles](https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/the-beatles/) other than the use of their music. Produced by Robert Stigwood and directed by Tom O’Horgan, the musical included 29 songs, primarily from the [*Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band*](https://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-beatles-sgt-pepper-turns-45/) and [*Abbey Road*](https://ultimateclassicrock.com/beatles-abbey-road/) LPs.

All of the songs were written by [John Lennon](https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/john-lennon/) and [Paul McCartney](https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/paul-mccartney/). [George Harrison](https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/george-harrison/) and [Ringo Starr](https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/ringo-starr/) declined to participate. “We put them together like a Tinkertoy set and made sense of it in our own way,” O’Horgan said in *The Theater Will Rock*. “We made a script of the songs, and we didn’t add additional dialogue or change the lyrics. Maybe we changed genders or something, but basically it was the songs with the original orchestrations. We were just trying to use this music in a different way.”

It was certainly different. The plot centered on Billy Shears (portrayed by Ted Neeley), a musician who becomes a star with the help of Maxwell’s Silver Hammermen, a motorcycle gang that represents the music industry. Shears marries his girlfriend, Strawberry Fields, who is later killed. All is well by the final curtain, as a statue of Sgt. Pepper (David Patrick Kelly) comes to life and orders everyone to ""Get Back.”

One of the Hammermen, B.G. Gibson, described the surreal production, created by scenic designer Robin Wagner. “There were the helium-filled weather balloons, which projections bounced off of while the Hammermen rotated them out over the audience in slow motion,"" he told the [*Good Day Sunshine*](http://www.meetthebeatlesforreal.com/2014/02/before-there-was-beatles-love-in-las.html)fanzine. ""There were the hundreds of pink Styrofoam Frisbees which the cast hurled into the audience at the end of Act I. There was a 30-foot Lucille Ball look-alike Statue of Liberty which was moved onto center stage to reveal ‘Polythene Pam’ ... There were the giant grandma and grandpa puppets who danced to 'When I’m Sixty-Four.’ There were the super life-sized busts of [Mick Jagger](https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/mick-jagger/) and [David Cassidy](https://diffuser.fm/tags/david-cassidy/), the huge wristwatch and hand, the smiling lips and teeth, and the larger-than-life octopus. There was also a Mylar confetti shower to be timed with ‘The End.’”

Celebrities flocked to the Beacon on opening night. John Lennon, who had watched several rehearsals, arrived with companion May Pang. [Yoko Ono](https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/yoko-ono/) also attended along with Andy Warhol, Bianca Jagger and “Papa” John Phillips.

It also dispenses with the two weakest cuts ""If I Needed Someone"" and ""What Goes On"" and replaces them with ""I've Just Seen A Face"" and ""It's Only Love"". ""Drive My Car"" would have been a great standalone single (with George's song on the flip?). Mono because they didn't do decent stereo until The Beatles."

I’m planning a surprise party and want to get him a cake with something Beatles related on it. For some reason I thought that Revolver was his favourite record so I initially planned to put that on a cake as an icing sheet, and I’d edited the artwork to hide some photos of him in it. I’ve since discovered that his favourite is actually The Beatles (White Album), so what would be the best way to translate this to a cake? Also open to other suggestions!

Some of Paul's more eccentric songs are my favorites on the album: Rocky Raccoon, Martha My Dear, and Why Dont We Do It In the Road, USSR.

But Happiness, Monkey, Revolution are more iconic songs than those.","I refuse to vote on this one...there is a great argument for each of them. While John, and Paul, had the greater output. George had by far the best tune on the album, although Pauls influence is very heavy on that tune.","Much to my surprise I chose Paul. I counted the songs I like or love by John and I got 10. When I counted the same for Paul, I got 12. 
Then again my favorite song on the album is George’s While My Guitar Gently Weeps.","It would be a tougher choice if we had to choose 4 best from John and Paul each, to put it on an equal footing. Song for Song, George is the best, but overall, I'd give the nod to John's stuff!","Hard to choose. I’m inclined to say that Paul wins merely for having written Blackbird, which in my view is the best song Paul ever wrote. That said, John doesn’t have any entries as lazy as Wild Honey Pie, or Why Don’t We Do It In The Road. And in my opinion Dear Prudence and Julia are probably my favorite post-India John Beatle tracks. I love Happiness is a Warm Gun but ironically I find it his most McCartney-esque composition, fusing three different song fragments, which reminds me of Uncle Albert or Back Seat of My Car, Live and Let Die, or Band On The Run. Paul’s I Will is a perfectly constructed little love song and interesting for the arrangement (vocal bass, skulls) as well as the lyrics (love song to your future dream girl soulmate whom you have yet to meet?) Typical of Paul, he offered good variety from classic rock and roll parody (Back in the USSR), to Jamaican (Ob la di), to whatever you call Martha My Dear (baroque pop?), to tin pan alley (Honey Pie), to porto-metal (Helter Skelter), to country/folk (Rocky Raccoon). It’s tough, but I think I’m leaning Paul.","This is so difficult! I have so many favourites by John and Paul but I think George has to win this one purely because, out of those four, three of them are all-time favourites of mine. The other two sets of songs are extremely strong but they can't compete with the ""75% all-time favourites"" number, because there are so many more of them.

In reality, I think they're all about even, but if I really had to choose one then I'd go for the one that I know will be last to try and even it out a bit.","Paul made the first punk song, and 2 of the most beautiful songs I’ve ever heard, and USSR + Ob La Di Ob La Da are quite good.",if the other two wouldve given george some credit and included not guilty and sour milk sea it wouldve been george,,,"I refuse to vote on this one...there is a great argument for each of them.

Then again my favorite song on the album is George’s While My Guitar Gently Weeps.It would be a tougher choice if we had to choose 4 best from John and Paul each, to put it on an equal footing. Song for Song, George is the best, but overall, I'd give the nod to John's stuff!Hard to choose. I’m inclined to say that Paul wins merely for having written Blackbird, which in my view is the best song Paul ever wrote. That said, John doesn’t have any entries as lazy as Wild Honey Pie, or Why Don’t We Do It In The Road. And in my opinion Dear Prudence and Julia are probably my favorite post-India John Beatle tracks. I love Happiness is a Warm Gun but ironically I find it his most McCartney-esque composition, fusing three different song fragments, which reminds me of Uncle Albert or Back Seat of My Car, Live and Let Die, or Band On The Run. Paul’s I Will is a perfectly constructed little love song and interesting for the arrangement (vocal bass, skulls) as well as the lyrics (love song to your future dream girl soulmate whom you have yet to meet?) Typical of Paul, he offered good variety from classic rock and roll parody (Back in the USSR), to Jamaican (Ob la di), to whatever you call Martha My Dear (baroque pop?), to tin pan alley (Honey Pie), to porto-metal (Helter Skelter), to country/folk (Rocky Raccoon). It’s tough, but I think I’m leaning Paul.This is so difficult! I have so many favourites by John and Paul but I think George has to win this one purely because, out of those four, three of them are all-time favourites of mine. The other two sets of songs are extremely strong but they can't compete with the ""75% all-time favourites"" number, because there are so many more of them.

In reality, I think they're all about even, but if I really had to choose one then I'd go for the one that I know will be last to try and even it out a bit.Paul made the first punk song, and 2 of the most beautiful songs I’ve ever heard, and USSR + Ob La Di Ob La Da are quite good.if the other two wouldve given george some credit and included not guilty and sour milk sea it wouldve been george","Who was the MVP of the White Album in your opinion?

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1c3awkq)I refuse to vote on this one...there is a great argument for each of them. While John, and Paul, had the greater output. George had by far the best tune on the album, although Pauls influence is very heavy on that tune.I voted John, but it was a HARD choice.

It’s like watching a tv series and one of the episodes is just a bunch of random chaotic scenes that make zero sense.It’s mid tier musique concrete that goes on a little too long. Works okay in the flow of an intentionally schizophrenic record. Respectably experimental idea. Sounds nothing like Pink Floyd especially Dark Side.It’s musique concrète 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musique_concr%C3%A8te?wprov=sfti1Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  I’m glad you like it.  

I listened to it when the White Album came out, and I hated it.  I listened to it again probably 30 years later, in the 1990s, and I hated it.  I won’t be listening to it again.I mean I respect this track for what it is and would never hate on it, but I’m not putting it in my playlist… all I’m sayingThe white album would not make any sense as a whole without R9 and Goodnight to wrap it up.The only way I could see thinking Revolution 9 is remotely similar to Floyd is if Umma Gumma is the only album you’ve heard, or if the only thing you know about Floyd is that they have some long songs.I just have it to show people The Beatles have weird stuff"

Mostly because it didn't come out overnight, John built that thing up for quite some time and struggled with it. It actually shows that songwriting isn't always plucking songs fully formed out of the ether (Yesterday being the classic counterexample), it's wrestling with your instrument to get the idea out of your head and into the real world.

If I was John, though, I would have hated being in a band with Macca in 1968-1970 though - quality songs just seemed to fall out of him during this time lol. Martha My Dear feels like he found the riff on the piano and just followed it through. It does have a lot of cool, interesting stuff in it though because Paul had interesting musical ideas and knew how to use them, but it strikes me as being much easier to write.

I actually think Hey Jude would have been an incredibly hard song to sit down and write without it sounding corny or forced. People try and write songs like it and they don't come close to Hey Jude's most enduring qualities. There's the effortless singalong melody, the lyrics which thread a needle between clear eyed optimism and a knowing cynicism - John was right, ""The movement you need is on your shoulder"" is the best line in the song - that relate to mostly everyone. It makes perfect sense that Paul wrote it away from an instrument, though. That kind of melodic ease and relaxation comes from not really thinking about Writing A Song and just making music while stuck in traffic with your voice for the sake of it.

George Harrison songs from 1968 on always are quite thoughtful and deliberately constructed - very chromatic writing and interesting non conventional use of harmony, eg WMGGW changing from A minor to A major is a wild keychange for an 'untrained' musician. Something changing from C to A in the bridge, Old Brown Shoe, Circles or Not Guilty. Some of these clearly took deep focus and skill to come up with and make sound natural. The only one that fails at that is Not Guilty, but that also has time signature changes on top of the weird harmony.

That said, the thing I envy the most about John's writing is the emotional openness without sacrificing writerly skill or craft. I could never write a song like Julia, that's such a raw nerve but John crafts a beautiful image and lyric without ever sounding overwrought or maudlin. There's a lot of nuance to John's writing that he himself downplayed for the veneer of authenticity, but being that authentic and real takes skill, insight, and discerning taste (with a lot of self-awareness) otherwise there'd be a billion John Lennons. But being able to take those emotions and distill them into words that aren't a slog or an embarrassment to listen to is a massively underrated skill.",Eleanor Rigby…and all those lonely people.,Golden Slumbers/Carry that weight/The End. amazing how it starts to the middle to the drum beat to the end amazing song structure!!!,"Song writing nearly always came naturally to Paul.

Seeing them really unfold in the studio after 1966 and the ultimate demise of their relationships as the only drama free Beatle.

Johns movie doesn't seem that interesting to me tbh. The Yoko story arch is something I have no interest in watching.

George's movie also seems not interesting as well. He was done being a Beatle in 1966, how is that supposed to be a fun movie? Also the India part of their history will be featured heavily in his movie and that's the exact part I want to skip in every docu or book about The Beatles.

Paul story could also be interesting as he was The Beatle that mainly carried on the group in 1968 onwards. His attemps to keep the group together seem interesting to me. Also the Paul is dead conspiracy and being the only Beatle that rejected Allen Klein seems like a good story to me.",,,,,,,,,"I still don't get how this is going to work.

Paul story could also be interesting as he was The Beatle that mainly carried on the group in 1968 onwards. His attemps to keep the group together seem interesting to me. Also the Paul is dead conspiracy and being the only Beatle that rejected Allen Klein seems like a good story to me.","My thoughts on the four new Beatles BiopicsI still don't get how this is going to work. Four movies telling the same story? And coming out at the same time? I don't get it. Why not ONE GOOD MOVIE. 

The Ringo movie seems to most interesting to me. A guy rolling into a pretty well established band suddenly becoming famous and having the best seat in the house watching John, Paul and George perform very close by.   
Seeing them really unfold in the studio after 1966 and the ultimate demise of their relationships as the only drama free Beatle.

It's hard to judge the market today, but in an ebay auction I feel you'd atleast get around $100 ÷/- $20. This is an early transitional pressing. This albums ""1st pressing"" has 3 different early label variations....


1st - no bmi or ascap written after the songs(really rare, only east coast pressings).
2nd - bmi written only after 1st song side 1 rest ascap.
3rd - the most common, bmi written after first 2 songs first side and I wanna be your man on side 2.


Your pressing is special where it's technically a third, but the earliest where they'd be using up the rest of the 2nd labels, so side 1 got the new 2 BMI label, but the old all ascap side 2 label. So like a 2.5. This variation is pretty rare, some may pay a little bit extra for it, but it'll be looked at and valued as a NM 3rd label variation by most since its still from the eame pressing batch as the other 3rds just the earliest of those(technically 3rd pressing though many label them all 1sts). Other things that line up with this is having no producer credit on the back, and no subsidary of capitol label.  


The best way to know for certain is to check the runout code and look it up on the site discogs. This is the etched markings all around the label on the smooth vinyl, on both sides. Discogs may not have your exact copy, so look for any symbol. Like IAM in a triangle is Scranton or a star symbol is Los angeles. From the pressing ring on the label it appears to be a Scranton third pressing. 


So I'm 99% sure it's the earliest batch of 3rd label Scrantons. 


So go to discogs, and check what other near mints of the same pressing are listed or going for. I highly advise watching it for a while and seeing what it goes for because alot of prices are skewed on discogs with people asking for alot more than it's worth. There's many records only worth $100 mint, yet on discogs one sold for $400 so everyone asks for that and it never sells. 


I think your best route would be to list it on ebay if you sell. Just write the runout and explain that it's an only 2 BMI label. Since this is unique and an early 3rd pressing, some may pay extra for it. It wouldn't be much extra, most would consider it just the earliest batch of 3rd pressings, but still it's worth mentioning because some beatles fans have been known to pay extra for stuff like that. 


Right now on ebay there's a strong VG copy of the same 2 BMI variation for $45. However, it's clearly been sitting for a while since it's price was lowered. So it's nothing crazy desirable. However, a NM is worth alot more than a VG. But no one's really paying extra for the 2 BMI label since if it was super desirable that would have sold long ago. 


So with all that said, you have to follow what others sold for and figure the best price, but if you ask for too much itll sit a long time. If you don't feel like doing much work just throw it on ebay for auction, that's your best bet. 


Here's 2 variants on discogs similar to yours. There's no listing for 2 BMI, but people will pay in line with these prices, maybe a bit more but not much... if you click on the image of the album you can see pictures and how it lines up with yours outside of the missing BMI.

1. LIB = Let It Be
2. GST = Gimme Some Truth Collection
3. ATMP = All Things Must Pass
4. LIBN = Let It Be Naked","My personalized Let It BeI like to personalize albums, then burn them into CDs for my car or whatever. Here is how it goes :
- **Get Back**. A montage of the 3 Rooftop Takes (take 2 on the intro and at the last ""Get Back!""s at the end, take 3 for the coda, and take 1 for everything in the middle, verses solos and chorus)
- **Dig A Pony**. The version on ""Get Back : the Rooftop Performance"" except i cut the first 1:45 minutes and replace them with ""God save the Queen"" which i cross fade as a transition to Dig A Pony
- **For You Blue**. The Naked version
- **The Long and Winding Road**. Phil Spector mix, i just wish the orchestras were less in the front
- **Two of Us**. Naked version
- **I’ve Got A Feeling**. Giles Martin remix, and i added The Walk jam as an intro
- **One After 909**. Glyn Johns mix
- **Don’t Let Me Down**. Naked version
- **I Me Mine**. Giles Martin remix
- **Across The Universe**. Naked version
- **Let It Be** (album version). Giles Martin remix

Yes i chose the Naked version tracklisting. Unfortunately i had to reject some songs :
- **All Things Must Pass**. Just because George recorded it later for his own album
- **Teddy Boy**. Same as George
- **Gimme Some Truth**. Same as George and Paul
- **Dig It**. If it went into the tracklisting i would have chose Glyn Johns mix put didn’t know where to pit it
- **Maggie Mae**. Same as Dig It
- **Without a Song**. It didn’t feel right to put it in the list even tho i like
- **I’m a Rocker / Save the Last Dance for Me**. Same as Without A Song
- **Rip It Up / Shake Rattle and Roll / Blue Suede Shoes**. Same as both before
- **Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues**. Same as these 3
- **Can You Dig It?**. I just didn’t like itI love it, how do you cut parts of the songs and add one like you did with Dig a Pony?Here’s mine:

1. Get Back 

2. The Long And Winding Road

3. Dig A Pony

4. I’ve Got A Feeling

5. Dig It (1969 Glyn Johns Mix)

6. I Me Mine

7. Two Of Us

8. The Ballad of John and Yoko

9. Don’t Let Me Down

10. One After 909

11. Old Brown Shoe (2023 Mix)

12. For You Blue (Naked Version)

13. Can You Dig It?

14. Across the Universe (Naked Version)

15. Let It Be (Album Version)

I made a personalized version of this too where all the songs transition into each other (turns out Dig A Pony transitions perfectly into I’ve Got A Feeling)My Let It Be

1. Get Back
2. Two of Us
3. Dig a Pony
4. Across The Universe (Naked)
5. I Me Mine
6. Dig It (Glyn Johns version)
7. Don't Let Me Down (Naked)
8. Medley: I'm Ready (aka Rocker)
9. I've Got a Feeling
10. One After 909
11. The Long and Winding Road (Naked)
12. She Came In Thru The Bathroom Window
13. For You Blue
14. Let It Be (Naked)I imagined an alternate Let It Be combining the LIB tracks with solo songs that existed in some way at the same time as the sessions.

Charlie is a great drummer in my opinion, and his bassist isn't bad, but I think Paul and Ringo can compete with any rock musician. However, they can't be called technicians. None of us are technical musicians. no one knew how to record what we recorded. we were musicians in their purest form, as people whose vocation is to make sounds, we are not worse than the rest.

End of story…Ask Pete why they took his kick drum for the Sheridan sessions.","Legitimate Questions From Pete Best Asking For An Explanation Of Why John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison Fired Him : “If I was such a terrible drummer why did the guys keep me around for two years ?” “Why did they keep me for the recording sessions with Tony Sheridan ?” (see comments)Umm...sorry, Pete. But I'll go with George Martin's opinion.If Pete was that great, another band would've gotten him as a replacement drummer.Of course Best is going to pump himself up. His timing was so notoriously bad that Bert Kaempfert had him stop playing his bass and toms during the Tony Sheridan recording. It’s why the three front boys started stomping when they played. To keep him in time.I can play this game, too. If Pete was so good, why didn't the Stones or Kinks snatch him up when they were looking for drummers well after his Beatles departure?

Truth is, you can be a good drummer (he's really not, though) and just not be right for the band. I've played with a LOT of drummers and sometimes you just click immediately and lock in and can play anything together and other times it's a slog just to get through a basic song with someone. Musical chemistry is a very real thing and Ringo obviously had it with the three others.Because they were desperate and needed a drummer to go to Hamburg.Look at that smug look on his face.

He did the literal same snare drum fill at the turn of every 4 bars in every early recording I’ve heard him on. Ringo was one of the most inventive drummers to ever do it.Pete was a really interesting drummer with a unique thumping style for the time... However, Ringo is one of the most versatile, tasteful and accurate drummers in the history of rock. The Beatles were lucky to snap him up when they did. It isn't that Pete wasn't capable (although on some softer songs his drumming seems kind of heavy handed and awkward)... it is just that Ringo was so much better.“Why did they keep me for the audition at Decca ? They knew how important that moment was and easily could have replaced me at any time before that.”

  
“If I was such a terrible drummer why did they guys have me play drums for multiple hours a night in Hamburg while trying to get record company executives to notice us ?” 

  
“Truth is I wasn’t a bad drummer at all. My playing was actually very good.” 

  
“When I found out they had replaced me with Ringo I was shocked because I always felt I was a better drummer.”

If it were up to you, would you have included all three reunion songs on the compilation?  Or none?

* Within You Without You
* Hey Bulldog
* Dear Prudence
* Oh! Darling

**Not against the inclusion but I'd probably include some other songs (in parenthesis) before these:** 

* Roll Over Beethoven (I Should've Known Better, If I Fell )
* You Really Got a Hold On Me (No Reply, I'm A Loser, I'll Follow the Sun, I'm Down)
* You Can't Do That (And Your Bird Can Sing, You're Gonna Lose That Girl, The Night Before, I've Just Seen a Face)
* Glass Onion (Happiness is a Warm Gun, The Inner Light, Helter Skelter)
* I Me Mine (Two Of Us, I've Got a Feeling, It's All Too Much)
* I Want You (She's So Heavy) (You Never Give Me Your Money, She Came in Through the Bathroom Window, Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End)
* Now and Then (just put it on an EP with a cleaned up Free as a Bird and Real Love, it doesn't fit with the compilations IMO)

  
**Original inclusions that I enjoy but am surprised they made the cut and feel there are better songs that were originally left off:** 

* Michelle
* Girl
* Magical Mystery Tour
* Old Brown Shoes"

Remember, none of the songs were solo efforts, even when Paul or John or George took ""complete"" control. They had each other to bounce off, they had George Martin and Brian Epstein who really didn't take enough credit for their work, they had orchestras to add extra flavour, they had sound engineers like Alan Parsons doing their thing, and sessions musicians like Billy Preston etc etc.

To go back to the question, I might steal a few bits and pieces here and there, but I could never pass off whole songs. Even the ones I know best, the ones I do in my band, I couldn't do justice to because I'm primarily a drummer and bassist. I couldn't possibly teach others all the guitar/piano parts and lyrics from scratch.Today? Idk… 

In the early 60s? Absolutely. Their music shaped generations of music moving forward, it’s hard to say where music would be today without them had they not happened 60 years ago. The landscape might be irretrievable. But if I can go back to the 60s and claim their stuff as mine…","If The Beatles never existed and you were the only one who remembered them, would you pass of their songs as your own.Yes I know that this is the plot to Yesterday but that film never explored the concept very well so we should do what Yesterday couldn’t do. Again this question is hypothetical and not to be taken seriously. 

Even though I’m not a musician (except a very mediocre drummer) I would pass The Beatles songs off as my own but I would exclude Please Please Me, With the Beatles & Beatles for Sale mostly because they are my least favourite Beatles albums  as they are kinda bland and forgettable and also “I Saw Her Standing There” with the lyrics “Well, she was just seventeen, You know what I mean” have not aged well at all. I would only focus on A Hard Days Night, Help! and onwards. I probly wouldn’t even try. One of the only things I liked about the Yesterday movie was the recurring bit about trying to remember the lyrics to Eleanor rigby. That’d be me but for all the songs and w zero musical abilityI saw her standing there has aged well. STFUI would only release Revolution 9.I liked the bit in Yesterday when he was playing Let It Be on the piano to have his family hear it but no one cared enough to pay attention.  I feel like that’s what would happen in the times we’re in.  A random amateur musician would be playing their versions of amazing songs to the world like Penny Lane, Help, Hey Jude etc. and get nowhere.  As much as we hate to admit it, the music industry goes beyond just raw talent or good songwriting.  It’s image and politics.What about the concept of Yesterday do you think was left unexplored by the film?None. The Beatles are the only one who can sing Beatles songs as evident by the multitude of bad covers that exist and won't mention. I would only do them a disservice by trying to play them. 

Yeah, and that part when he met John Lennon made me ugly cry. To imagine a world where John is still with us and has been all this time. I remember his asssassination as a young boy in NYC.I don't think it would work. They were amazing and there music came at the right time. They were the foundations of much of today's music. If you brought it out now a lot of their songs probably wouldn't workThe melody of I saw her standing there is amazing tbh. I would take that.You're assuming I could remember the lyrics or could work out the music from memory 😂 I know some of the lyrics to some of the songs, I know the chord progressions from a couple of songs, the bass lines from a few more.

They would also be able to have input in each others material. So nothing beats the Beatles in terms of creating strong songs. With that said, I think in their solo work they could finally be themselves completely, which enabled them to create better art on average. Plastic Ono Band is one of the least prententious albums in history. So raw, so honest, so personal. All Things Must Pass has this lovely combination of the Motown sound, soft rock and spirituality. Band on the Run is a beautiful examples of creative and playful musicianship. I´m a massive Beatles fan and I as well would´ve loved for them to be together longer, but I´m also very happy about their solo work, because we got 100% John, 100% Paul and 100% George (and Ringo of course).","I usually make 8+8+8+4 Double Albums.

My rule is that the songs included need to be released with 12-18 months of each other.

I split *All Things Must Pass* into two albums, one for 1970 and for 71.

*Band on the Run* was released in Dec 73, so I lump it with the 74 LPs.

Keep in mind that LPs were about 22 minutes a side in the 70s.","I know you’ve got 100 or more of these and other various themes Beatles fan albums, and the many I have seen are fantastic, or at least interesting.

I usually don't combine Beatles and solo Beatles on a fan album but I gave it a shot here. I imagined a 14 track last Beatles album combining Let It Be tracks with solo songs that we know were ""around"" in one form or another at the time of the sessions. What do you think?

My rule is that the songs included need to be released with 12-18 months of each other.

I split *All Things Must Pass* into two albums, one for 1970 and for 71.

*Band on the Run* was released in Dec 73, so I lump it with the 74 LPs.

Keep in mind that LPs were about 22 minutes a side in the 70s.Of course if they had stayed together, 3 great composers contributing instead of one is an advantage. They would also be able to have input in each others material. So nothing beats the Beatles in terms of creating strong songs. With that said, I think in their solo work they could finally be themselves completely, which enabled them to create better art on average. Plastic Ono Band is one of the least prententious albums in history. So raw, so honest, so personal. All Things Must Pass has this lovely combination of the Motown sound, soft rock and spirituality. Band on the Run is a beautiful examples of creative and playful musicianship. I´m a massive Beatles fan and I as well would´ve loved for them to be together longer, but I´m also very happy about their solo work, because we got 100% John, 100% Paul and 100% George (and Ringo of course).I know you’ve got 100 or more of these and other various themes Beatles fan albums, and the many I have seen are fantastic, or at least interesting. Have you made the “14 solo songs that could have and should have been Beatles songs” playlist yet?Not quite. I do have this one though...

I usually don't combine Beatles and solo Beatles on a fan album but I gave it a shot here. I imagined a 14 track last Beatles album combining Let It Be tracks with solo songs that we know were ""around"" in one form or another at the time of the sessions. What do you think?

14. Come and Get It","""If they never broke up"" Fan AlbumsWhen I began an almost two year very deep dive into my revived Beatle fandom, I first latched onto these ""if they never broke up"" albums compiling solo material. I was hooked.

I think that The Beatles were better whole than than the sum of their parts. In their solo careers, they all have classic songs, really good songs, good songs and...let's admit...clunkers.

Putting together yearly compilations of solo Beatles material has been fun, creative, and challenging.

I keep my fan albums to 14 tracks, like the old Beatles UK albums. I use the 4/4/4/2 song distribution suggested by John at the meeting to discuss a possible Abbey Road follow up. I can go back a year or 2 for songs, but not forward.

The 14 track thing makes it challenging. It limits selections so they don't turn into 3 hour playlists.

I've enjoyed sharing some of them with redditors here. Try this out for yourselves! You'll have a lot of fun. ❤️✌️🎸I usually make 8+8+8+4 Double Albums.

Revolution 9 works as the musical climax of the entire album and to take it away would really subtract from the grandness and theatrics of both the  song and album. It’s not supposed to be listened to by itself as a song but within the context of the album. 

For the entire album you go through so many different genres of music that you think you’ve heard everything by the end, but then near the end you get to the cryptic and haunting Cry Baby Cry that ends in an unsettling acoustic piece., but then the uneasiness continues with faded talking and a creepy voice, that doesn’t sound like any of the Beatles starts saying *revolution* over and over. Then follows an 8 minute Amalgamation of sound that very few in 1968 would’ve ever heard before, the song even sampling other Beatles songs (iirc). And once you get used to the song it stops and the orchestra of the finale, Goodnight comes in and pays off the almost 9 minutes of tension with the musical polar opposite of what you’ve listened to for the past 13 minutes 


people like to say Hey Jude should replace it but that wouldn’t work at all. Yeah it’s a good song but it can’t replace the feeling and amazing concept of the white album is trying to show off with Revolution 9. It’s like an exposition scene in a movie, no it’s not really enjoyable on it’s own that much but the entire project can’t really work well without it

Essentially *Please Please Me* and *With The Beatles* plus any EP's and singles. When their popularity was growing in the UK and Europe only.


British Invasion (1964-early 1966)


Everything from *A Hard Days Night*, *Beatles For Sale*, Help!, and Rubber Soul. Plus EP's and singles. The era is the band's increasing popularity, particularly in the US. This overlaps with Proto-Psychedelia in late 1965 (*Rubber Soul*).


Proto-Psychedelia (mid to late 1965): *see above* 


Psychedelia (mid 1966 - late 1968)


Starting with *Revolver* then going to *Pepper*, *Magical Mystery Tour*, and the *Yellow Submarine* soundtrack. And yes it was released in 1969, but it's clearly a product of the time in which the originals were made (2/68 and 10/68), not released. 


Post-Psychedelia (mid 1968 - early 1969)


Encompassing all sessions for *The BEATLES* this is an album that deserves its own heading. It isn't the clean pure rock of what came after it, still holding tightly at psychedelic influences in lyrics and music, but also showing a definite genesis away from the draggy, almost catatonic style of some songs on Pepper and MMT.  


The Pinnacle (early 1969 - mid 1969)


Sessions for *Get Back* (later *Let It Be*) and *Abbey Road*, this is the best the band ever was. They had many years experience behind them and were able to make some of their most advanced work. It flows and sounds very much like bands of the era without losing that Beatles touch. 


The Anthology Era (1994-1996)


The 90's archival releases (along with *Live at the BBC*, the *Anthology* documentary, and the two new songs) reinvigorated old fans and made new fans of the group. It was their rebirth in the modern era. It was also helped by Paul McCartney releasing his most Beatles flavored solo record *Flaming Pie*, and his assertion to embrace the Beatles catalog and play a set list primarily dominated by the band's music. 


The New Century (2000-2010) 


With the compilation album *1* topping the charts in tons of places, and it becoming a huge hit for the band, the first decade of the 21st century was huge for The Beatles. They introduced *yet another* innovation by partnering with Cirque du Soleil for the Las Vegas show *LOVE*, with their faces plastered on the top floors of The Mirage even to this day! A soundtrack album of the same name was released in 2006, and became a lot of the newer fans way into fandom. Dhani Harrison also worked with Harmonix, manufacturers of the hottest video game craze of the 00's...*Rock Band*. Now you could not only listen to The Beatles you and your friends could actually be The Beatles. This coincided with all the Beatles music being available on streaming services on the date of release (9/9/09). Sadly we also lost George during this period, but the *Concert For George* was a big hit and helped to cement his contributions to the band and music in general. 


The Remasters Era (2011 - Current) 


We now as fans sit and wait for new remasters from Giles Martin. What will the new set contain? What mysteries will be unearthed in the vaults? As we sit and wait year after year, the intensity only gets dialed up more, and this little Rock n Roll outfit from Liverpool that only existed for eight years as a recording entity still captures the hearts and minds of everyone.

George had his Indian “transcendental” period, which included his Wonderwall album and then the sitar-flavored songs sprinkled into the Beatles albums. 

John had his avant garde period. With the two Unfinished Music albums and the Wedding Album, as well as his sound pictures on band albums such as Tomorrow Never Knows and Revolution #9.

Paul has his own forays outside of the Beatles, including his Family Way soundtrack album and the non album single “Love in the open air” all
Credited equally to Paul and the George Martin orchestra.  I think this material demonstrates his trend to the more “poppy” material in the later albums, such as songs like Your Mother Should Know and Maxwell. 

Ringo was probably the first Beatle to demonstrate a sub- chapter with the country and blues songs that he loved, including Act Naturally and What Goes On.  You can also see this on Don’t Pass Me By.","For me, Rubber Soul was beginning of second phase. The experimentation with psychedelics/weed triggered it.

Everything from *A Hard Days Night*, *Beatles For Sale*, Help!, and Rubber Soul. Plus EP's and singles. The era is the band's increasing popularity, particularly in the US. This overlaps with Proto-Psychedelia in late 1965 (*Rubber Soul*).


Proto-Psychedelia (mid to late 1965): *see above* 


Psychedelia (mid 1966 - late 1968)


Starting with *Revolver* then going to *Pepper*, *Magical Mystery Tour*, and the *Yellow Submarine* soundtrack. And yes it was released in 1969, but it's clearly a product of the time in which the originals were made (2/68 and 10/68), not released. 


Post-Psychedelia (mid 1968 - early 1969)


Encompassing all sessions for *The BEATLES* this is an album that deserves its own heading. It isn't the clean pure rock of what came after it, still holding tightly at psychedelic influences in lyrics and music, but also showing a definite genesis away from the draggy, almost catatonic style of some songs on Pepper and MMT.  


The Pinnacle (early 1969 - mid 1969)


Sessions for *Get Back* (later *Let It Be*) and *Abbey Road*, this is the best the band ever was. They had many years experience behind them and were able to make some of their most advanced work. It flows and sounds very much like bands of the era without losing that Beatles touch. 


The Anthology Era (1994-1996)


The 90's archival releases (along with *Live at the BBC*, the *Anthology* documentary, and the two new songs) reinvigorated old fans and made new fans of the group. It was their rebirth in the modern era. It was also helped by Paul McCartney releasing his most Beatles flavored solo record *Flaming Pie*, and his assertion to embrace the Beatles catalog and play a set list primarily dominated by the band's music. 


The New Century (2000-2010) 


With the compilation album *1* topping the charts in tons of places, and it becoming a huge hit for the band, the first decade of the 21st century was huge for The Beatles. They introduced *yet another* innovation by partnering with Cirque du Soleil for the Las Vegas show *LOVE*, with their faces plastered on the top floors of The Mirage even to this day! A soundtrack album of the same name was released in 2006, and became a lot of the newer fans way into fandom. Dhani Harrison also worked with Harmonix, manufacturers of the hottest video game craze of the 00's...*Rock Band*. Now you could not only listen to The Beatles you and your friends could actually be The Beatles. This coincided with all the Beatles music being available on streaming services on the date of release (9/9/09). Sadly we also lost George during this period, but the *Concert For George* was a big hit and helped to cement his contributions to the band and music in general. 


The Remasters Era (2011 - Current) 


We now as fans sit and wait for new remasters from Giles Martin. What will the new set contain? What mysteries will be unearthed in the vaults? As we sit and wait year after year, the intensity only gets dialed up more, and this little Rock n Roll outfit from Liverpool that only existed for eight years as a recording entity still captures the hearts and minds of everyone. Not too bad.I go by drugs. Early Beatles on speed …. then weed …. then acid ….then smackEvery year seems to have a different sound, different tech restrictions, different look for each member, different approach to songwriting, etc. 8 eras.I think there are also sub-periods involving individual band members who went off on their own to record songs / albums and then later influenced the band’s catalog. 

George had his Indian “transcendental” period, which included his Wonderwall album and then the sitar-flavored songs sprinkled into the Beatles albums. 

John had his avant garde period. With the two Unfinished Music albums and the Wedding Album, as well as his sound pictures on band albums such as Tomorrow Never Knows and Revolution #9.

Paul has his own forays outside of the Beatles, including his Family Way soundtrack album and the non album single “Love in the open air” all
Credited equally to Paul and the George Martin orchestra.  I think this material demonstrates his trend to the more “poppy” material in the later albums, such as songs like Your Mother Should Know and Maxwell. 

Ringo was probably the first Beatle to demonstrate a sub- chapter with the country and blues songs that he loved, including Act Naturally and What Goes On.  You can also see this on Don’t Pass Me By.For me, Rubber Soul was beginning of second phase. The experimentation with psychedelics/weed triggered it.
You can literally see the distortion starting to take effect.
(Warped pic on cover)Early period = Please Please Me to Help!

Middle Period = Rubber Soul to Magical Mystery Tour/Yellow Submarine

Later Period = White Album to Let It Be


I consider Help! and Yellow Submarine as bridges between the early to middle periods and middle to later periods respectively1st era is pre Hard days night. Still suffered a bit of control of label, in my view, cover tunes,,etc..their weakest period. Then Hard days night to revolver.. Independence, and Dominance established., Then Pepper, through White Album, Psychedelia, and more dominance

Finally Abbey Road/Let it be.  The Encore."

The Atmos mixes on AppleMusic.,"If you'd like to hear the versions preferred by The Beatles themselves, then you should check out the mono mixes. The only full mono albums available on streaming are Revolver and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: just go to the respective super deluxe version and scroll down until the track listing repeats itself.

Overall, the 2009 remasters aren't as accurate to the original releases as the original 80s CDs are. Not only do the 2009s have boosted bass, but they also edited out a ton of extraneous noises present on the original recordings, such as lip smacks, plosives, and pickup switch clicking. The 2009 stereo remaster of She Said She Said in particular is very muddy compared to the original CD.

Help! and Rubber Soul's original stereo mixes are not on streaming unfortunately. Instead, we have the remixes done in the 80s for the original CD release (the Help! remix has a lot of new reverb). The 1965 stereo mixes can be found as bonus tracks on the 2009 mono CDs of the albums, as well as on the rare pre-2009 Canadian CDs manufactured by Disque Americ.

To sum it up, the most *authentic sounding* versions of The Beatles' albums are not on streaming for the most part (the exceptions are the mono Revolver and Sgt. Pepper's from the super deluxes).

Overall, the 2009 remasters aren't as accurate to the original releases as the original 80s CDs are.

The 2009 stereo remaster of She Said She Said in particular is very muddy compared to the original CD.

Help! and Rubber Soul's original stereo mixes are not on streaming unfortunately. Instead, we have the remixes done in the 80s for the original CD release (the Help! remix has a lot of new reverb).

P.S.: posting it again because I noticed there was an error in the title.It’s what it sounds like from what I know- “there once was a woman that loved a moondog.” I assume he is riffing - moondog goes back to Johnny and the Moondogs. Moondog also was a lyric in I Dig a Pony, so it wasn’t completely out of the blue. Maybe he was glancing at Yoko and wrote her a 4 second song?"

Certainly the loss of Brian...way up on the list.","I seriously doubt that *Magical Mystery Tour* would have happened, or at least it would have been different.

I also think they still may have done solo LPs as a way to let off some steam, so to speak.","John was exhausted, as anyone would be after the run they'd had, putting out two albums a year and touring incessantly. That left a power vacuum when Brian died, and Paul became their de facto manager, making sure they stuck to the regular Beatle schedule (minus the incessant touring). That was the beginning of the end.

Whenever I look at that year, 1967, and see that they released ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" *and* Sgt Pepper *and* Magical Mystery Tour, whereas nowadays bands routinely go two or three or five years between albums, astounds me.","I was there (a teen at the time). Losing Epstein was huge. They all really were hurting after he died, and you're right about this being the beginning of the breakup. I had a friend whose mom worked for Alan Klein. She has a bunch of master tapes from Beatle recording sessions. We played them. It was just instrumental tracks, so we'd put them on and sing the vocal parts, with the actual Beatles playing behind us. It was a lot of fun.","Business-wise and personally, sure. Creatively? No way in hell and that’s all that really matters in the end","I feel like I’ve seen them kind of acknowledge this themselves, but maybe I’m just imagining it…","Continued through the early 1970s?

George still gets restless with a growing stack of songs he can’t get on albums.","It feels like the band slowly fell apart after Brian Epstein diedHe died in August 1967.

The band then went through the troubled recording of the White Album, and the even more troubled recording of Let it Be.

They were essentially for all intents and purposes over as of September 1969 when John left, even if the “official” public breakup didn’t occur until April 1970.

Given this timeline - 

basically two years from Epstein’s death to the end - 

I have to think that his death was basically the beginning of the end. 

Sort of like the band was rudderless without him to be the tie breaker, for them to turn to for guidance. 

Instead they turned inward and eventually on each other.

I mean if we break down the essential elements of the breakup, each can be traced back to Brian’s death.

Bringing in Allen Klein - would not have happened if Brian was still alive

Paul taking a more controlling interest - He was trying to act as de facto manager and leader of a drifting ship. If Brian was still alive, he could’ve guided them forward

They basically had to take on the immense stress of not only *being* The Beatles, but also now *managing* The Beatles and running the business affairs - the latter two they hadn’t worried about prior; Brian took care of that

I really feel if Brian hadn’t died they’d have continued as band for a few years longer, at least up through the early 1970s.There's a lot of different theories for why they broke up and a lot of different reasons, but this is the one I've given the most stock to.“I knew that we were in trouble then.

If that is true, then it can't have been the US version.","Drive My Car is one of the best album openers in history! Replacing it with a jaunty, relatively casual Just Seen a Face - the perfect pick-me-up following, say, a ballad or something weightier is nonsensical.  

The folk-rock conceit works, sort of, but It’s Only Love is so clearly part of the Early Beatles ethos that it sticks out like a sore thumb in the dope drenched maturity of RS. Can’t agree that the US version is superior. 

However there’s a third option that would arguably improve upon the UK version, eg binning What Goes On and either Wait or Run For Your Life and inserting the contemporaneous single. So something like this; 

Side A 
1 DMC  
2 Norwegian  
3 You Won’t See Me  
4 We Can Work it Out 
5 Think For Yourself  
6 The Word  
7 Michelle

2 Girl  
3 I’m Looking Through You  
4 In My Life  
5 Nowhere Man  
6 If I Needed Someone

It’s mixed in stereo but all panned hard, left and right. Maybe double mono? Anyway, it has Nowhere Man. And listening to that tape is what got me starting to record and write songs. Still love the album, I have it in several different media forms and incarnations at this point.","It works, but the exclusion of Nowhere Man is a sin against humanity.I can’t listen to I’m Looking Through You without the false start.I read somewhere that Brian's favourite song on the album was Nowhere Man (not surprising knowing Brian).

If that is true, then it can't have been the US version.Drive My Car is one of the best album openers in history! Replacing it with a jaunty, relatively casual Just Seen a Face - the perfect pick-me-up following, say, a ballad or something weightier is nonsensical.  

The folk-rock conceit works, sort of, but It’s Only Love is so clearly part of the Early Beatles ethos that it sticks out like a sore thumb in the dope drenched maturity of RS. Can’t agree that the US version is superior. 

However there’s a third option that would arguably improve upon the UK version, eg binning What Goes On and either Wait or Run For Your Life and inserting the contemporaneous single. So something like this; 

Side A 
1 DMC  
2 Norwegian  
3 You Won’t See Me  
4 We Can Work it Out 
5 Think For Yourself  
6 The Word  
7 Michelle  

Side B  
1 Day Tripper  
2 Girl  
3 I’m Looking Through You  
4 In My Life  
5 Nowhere Man  
6 If I Needed Someone  
7 RFYL/Wait

I do love the standard version of it , and it’s highly regarded for me as one of my favorites, but I always thought songs like Drive My Car,  What’s Goes On, and Even If I Needed Someone , didn’t really fit , as they were pretty different to other songs on the album. With the American version it takes out Drive My Car, What Goes On, If I Needed Someone, and Nowhere Man(which I wished stayed on the album tbh) And added two Help! songs (which aren’t on the Help! album in America because the album was soundtrack of the movie) It’s Only Love and I’ve Just Seen A Face, they fit well with the rest of the album , and I’ve Just Seen A Face being a great, and better album opener than Drive My Car.It works, but the exclusion of Nowhere Man is a sin against humanity.I can’t listen to I’m Looking Through You without the false start.I read somewhere that Brian's favourite song on the album was Nowhere Man (not surprising knowing Brian).
